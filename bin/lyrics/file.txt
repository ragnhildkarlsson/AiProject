i am not skilled to understand
what god has willed
what god has planned
i only know at his right hand
stands one who is my saviour
  i am not skilled
i take him at his word and deed
christ died to save me this i read
and in my heart i find a need
for him to be my saviour


that he would leave his place on high
and come for sinful man to die
you count it strange so once did i
before i knew my saviour



my saviour loves my saviour lives
my saviour’s always there for me
my god he was my god he is
my god he’s always gonna be

yes living dying let me bring
my strength my solace
from this spring
that he who lives to be my king
once died to be my saviour


that he would leave his place on high
and come for sinful man to die
you count it strange so once did i
before i knew my saviour


my saviour loves my saviour lives
my saviour’s always there for me
my god he was my god he is
my god he’s always gonna be


my saviour lives my saviour loves
my saviour lives my saviour loves
my saviour lives

its beauty laid low

o where are the reapers that garner in
the sheaves of the good from the fields of sin
with sickles of truth must the work be done
and no one may rest till the “harvest home”
   
      
      
    
     

where are the reapers o who will come
and share in the glory of the “harvest home”
o who will help us to garner in
the sheaves of good from the fields of sin

      
     
      
    

go out in the byways and search them all
the wheat may be there but the weeds are tall
then search in the highway and pass none by
but gather them all for the home on high
   
    
     
    

where are the reapers o who will come
and share in the glory of the “harvest home”
o who will help us to garner in
the sheaves of good from the fields of sin

      
     
      
    

the fields are all ripening and far and wide
the world now is waiting the harvest tide
but reapers are few and the work is great
and much will be lost should the harvest wait
      
     
    
     

where are the reapers o who will come
and share in the glory of the “harvest home”
o who will help us to garner in
the sheaves of good from the fields of sin

      
     
      
    

so come with your sickles ye sons of men
and gather together the golden grain
toil on till the lord of the harvest come
then share ye his joy in the “harvest home”
    
    
   -

amazing grace how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me
i once was lost but now am found
was blind but now i see

’twas grace that taught my heart to fear
and grace my fears relieved
how precious did that grace appear
the hour i first believed
  amazing grace



my chains are gone i’ve been set free
my god my saviour has ransomed me
and like a flood his mercy reigns
unending love amazing grace



the lord has promised good to me
his word my hope secures
he will my shield and portion be
as long as life endures



my chains are gone i’ve been set free
my god my saviour has ransomed me
and like a flood his mercy reigns
unending love amazing grace





the earth shall soon dissolve like snow
the sun forbear to shine
but god who called me here below
will be forever mine


one day when heaven was filled with his praises
one day when sin was as black as could be
jesus came forth to be born of a virgin
dwelt among men my example is he
  

    
     
     
     

living he loved me dying he saved me
buried he carried my sins far away
rising he justified freely forever
one day he’s comingo glorious day

      
     
   
  
     

one day they led him up calvary’s mountain
one day they nailed him to die on the tree
suffering anguish despised and rejected
bearing our sins my redeemer is he

    
    
      
     

living he loved me dying he saved me
buried he carried my sins far away
rising he justified freely forever
one day he’s comingo glorious day

      
     
   
  
     

one day they left him alone in the garden
one day he rested from suffering free
angels came down o’er his tomb to keep vigil
hope of the hopeless my saviour is he

     
    
      
    

living he loved me dying he saved me
buried he carried my sins far away
rising he justified freely forever
one day he’s comingo glorious day

      
     
   
  
     

one day the grave could conceal him no longer
one day the stone rolled away from the door
then he arose over death he had conquered
now is ascended my lord evermore

   
   
    
    

living he loved me dying he saved me
buried he carried my sins far away
rising he justified freely forever
one day he’s comingo glorious day

      
     
   
  
     

one day the trumpet will sound for his coming
one day the skies with his glory will shine
wonderful day my beloved ones bringing
glorious saviour this jesus is mine

   
     
    
     


living he loved me dying he saved me
buried he carried my sins far away
rising he justified freely forever

and has prepared a place for me
and crowns of victory he giveth
to those who would his children be

instil a peace and trust within my soul
amid life’s tempest stay thou o’er beside me
bring me at last to my heavenly goal

’tis the grandest theme for a mortal tongue

great god we sing your mighty hand
by which supported still we stand
the opening year your mercy shows
that mercy crowns it ’til its close
   
   
     
    
    

by day by night at home abroad
still are we guarded by our god
by his incessant bounty fed
by his unerring counsel led
     
   
    
    

with grateful hearts the past we own
the future all to us unknown
we to thy guardian care commit
and peaceful leave before thy feet
  
      
    
   


in scenes exalted or depressed
you are our joy and you our rest
your goodness all our hopes shall raise
adored through all our changing days
      
     
    
     


i stand amazed in the presence
of jesus the nazarene
and wonder how he could love me
a sinner condemned unclean


o how marvellous o how wonderful
and my song shall ever be
o how marvellous o how wonderful
is my saviour’s love for me
i stand amazed
for me it was in the garden
he prayed “not my will but thine”
he had no tears for his own griefs
but sweat drops of blood for mine


o how marvellous o how wonderful
and my song shall ever be
o how marvellous o how wonderful
is my saviour’s love for me
in pity angels beheld him
and came from the world of light
to comfort him in the sorrows
he bore for my soul that night


o how marvellous o how wonderful
and my song shall ever be
o how marvellous o how wonderful
is my saviour’s love for me
he took my sins and my sorrows
he made them his very own
he bore the burden to calvary
and suffered and died alone


o how marvellous o how wonderful
and my song shall ever be
o how marvellous o how wonderful
is my saviour’s love for me

when with the ransomed in glory
his face i at last shall see
’twill be my joy through the ages
to sing of his love for me


o how marvellous o how wonderful
and my song shall ever be
o how marvellous o how wonderful
is my saviour’s love for me


beneath the cross of jesus
i fain would take my stand
the shadow of a mighty rock
within a weary land
  
  
  
    
   

a home within the wilderness
a rest upon the way
from the burning of the noontide heat
and the burden of the day
   
  
   
   

o safe and happy shelter
o refuge tried and sweet
o trysting place where heaven’s love
and heaven’s justice meet
  
 
     
  

as to the holy patriarch
that wondrous dream was given
so seems my saviour’s cross to me
a ladder up to heaven
    
  
    
    

upon the cross of jesus
mine eyes at times can see
the very dying form of one
who suffered there for me
   
    
  
   

and from my stricken heart with tears
two wonders i confess
the wonders of redeeming love
and my unworthiness
   
  
  
  

i take o cross thy shadow
for my abiding place
i ask no other sunshine than
the sunshine of his face
   
  
     
   


content to let the world go by
to know no gain nor loss
my sinful self my only shame
my glory all the cross
   
   
   
  


make me a captive lord
and then i shall be free
force me to render up my sword
and i shall conqueror be
   
   
     
 
  

i sink in life’s alarms
when by myself i stand
imprison me within thine arms
and strong shall be my hand
  
   
   
   

my heart is weak and poor
until its master find
it has no spring of action sure
it varies with the wind
  
  
      
  

it cannot freely move
till thou hast wrought its chain
enslave it with thy matchless love
and deathless it shall reign
   
   
   
  

my power is faint and low
till i have learned to serve
it wants the needed fire to glow
it wants the breeze to nerve
   
    
    
   

it cannot drive the world
until itself be driv’n
its flag can only be unfurled
when thou shalt breathe from heav’n
   
   
   
 

my will is not my own
till thou hast made it thine
if it would reach a monarch’s throne
it must its crown resign
   
  
     
  


it only stands unbent
amid the clashing strife
when on thy bosom it has leant
and found in thee its life
  
   
    
    


o think of the home over there
by the side of the river of light
where the saints all immortal and fair
are robed in their garments of light
-     
   
     
    
  

over there over there
o think of the home over there
over there over there
o think of the home over there

   
   
   
   

my saviour is now over there
there my kindred and friends are at rest
then away from my sorrow and care
let me fly to the land of the blest
    
    
    
    

over there over there
o think of the home over there
over there over there
o think of the home over there

   
   
   
   

i’ll soon be at home over there
for the end of my journey i see
many dear to my heart over there
are watching and waiting for me
    
   
     
    


over there over there
o think of the home over there
over there over there
o think of the home over there

e’er to take as from a father’s hand
one by one the days the moments fleeting

for the son of god who came
ruined sinners to reclaim

spotless lamb of god was he
full atonement can it be

now in heaven exalted high

all his ransomed home to bring
then anew this song we’ll sing
hallelujah what a saviour

tow’ring o’er the wrecks of time
all the light of sacred story
gathers round its head sublime

hopes deceive and fears annoy
never shall the cross forsake me
lo it glows with peace and joy

light and love upon my way
from the cross the radiance streaming
adds more lustre to the day

peace is there that knows no measure
joys that thro’ all time abide

there was one who was willing
to die in my stead
that a soul so unworthy might live
and the path to the cross
he was willing to tread
all the sins of my life to forgive
  

     
    
     
    

they are nailed to the cross
they are nailed to the cross
o how much he was willing to bear
with what anguish and loss
jesus went to the cross
but he carried my sins with him there

     
    
     
     

he is tender and loving and patient with me
while he cleanses my heart of the dross
but “there’s no condemnation”
i know i am free
for my sins are all nailed to the cross
     
    
      
    

they are nailed to the cross
they are nailed to the cross
o how much he was willing to bear
with what anguish and loss
jesus went to the cross
but he carried my sins with him there

     
    
     
     

i will cling to my saviour and never depart
i will joyfully journey each day
with a song on my lips
and a song in my heart
that my sins have been taken away
       
      
       
     


they are nailed to the cross

there’s a dear and precious book
though it’s worn and faded now
which recalls those happy days of long ago
when i stood at mother’s knee
with her hand upon my brow
and i heard her voice in gentle tones and low
     
   
  
   
   
  
      


blessd book precious book
on thy dear old tear stained leaves i love to look
thou art sweeter day by day
as i walk the narrow way
that leads at last to that bright home above

   
    
    
   
      

then she read of jesus’ love
as he blessed the children dear
how he suffered bled and died upon the tree
of his heavy load of care
then she dried my flowing tears
with her kisses as she said it was for me
  
   
      
    
    
     


blessd book precious book
on thy dear old tear stained leaves i love to look
thou art sweeter day by day
as i walk the narrow way

well those days are past and gone
but their memory lingers still
and the dear old book each day has been
my guide
and i seek to do his will
as my mother taught me then
and ever in my heart his words abide

to the trees where the wild flowers
bloom
where the farewell hymn will be chanted
i shall rest by her side in the tomb

to list’n to the clear ringing bell
its tones so sweetly are calling

oh come to the church in the vale
no spot is so dear to my childhood
as the little brown church in the vale

     
      
   
   
from the church in the valley
by the wildwood
when day fades away into night
i would fain from this spot of my
childhood
wing my way to the mansions of light

and the powers of nature fade
still will i sing through death’s cold shade
christ for me christ for me 
    
  
     
   


what good is it
to gain the whole world
but lose your soul
what good is it
to make a sweet sound
but remain proud

in view of god’s mercy
i offer my all
  what good is it


and take my life let it be
ev’rything all of me
here i am use me for your glory

in ev’rything i say and do
let my life honour you
here i am living for your glory

the road i’m on
it leads nowhere
without you
and the life i lead
it finds meaning

jesus keep me near the cross
there a precious fountain
free to all a healing stream
flows from calvary’s mountain
   
   
 
   
   

in the cross in the cross
be my glory ever
’til my raptured soul shall find
rest beyond the river

   
   
  
  

near the cross a trembling soul
love and mercy found me
there the bright and morning star
shed its beams around me
   
  
   
  

in the cross in the cross
be my glory ever
’til my raptured soul shall find
rest beyond the river

   
   
  
  

near the cross o lamb of god
bring its scenes before me
help me walk from day to day
with its shadows o’er me
   
  
    
  

in the cross in the cross
be my glory ever
’til my raptured soul shall find
rest beyond the river

   
   
  
  

near the cross i’ll watch and wait
hoping trusting ever
’til i reach the golden strand
just beyond the river
    
   
   
  


in the cross in the cross
be my glory ever
’til my raptured soul shall find
rest beyond the river

not now but in the coming years
it may be in the better land
we’ll read the meaning of our tears
and there some time we’ll understand
-    
-    
      
  
  

then trust in god through all the days
fear not for he doth hold thy hand
though dark thy way still sing and praise
some time some time we’ll understand

  
    
    
      

we’ll catch the broken thread again
and finish what we here began
heav’n will the mysteries explain
and then ah then we’ll understand
  
  
   
    

then trust in god through all the days
fear not for he doth hold thy hand
though dark thy way still sing and praise
some time some time we’ll understand

  
    
    
      

we’ll know why clouds instead of sun
were over many a cherished plan
why song has ceased when scarce begun
’tis there some time we’ll understand
   
     
    
    

then trust in god through all the days
fear not for he doth hold thy hand
though dark thy way still sing and praise
some time some time we’ll understand

  
    
    
      

god knows the way he holds the key
he guides us with unerring hand
some time with tearless eyes we’ll see
yes there up there we’ll understand
     
     
     
      


then trust in god through all the days
fear not for he doth hold thy hand
though dark thy way still sing and praise
some time some time we’ll understand

  
    
    
      


while shepherds watched their flocks
by night
all seated on the ground
the angel of the lord came down
and glory shone around

“fear not” said he for mighty dread
had seized their troubled mind
“glad tidings of great joy i bring
to you and all mankind
  while shepherds watched

“to you in david’s town this day
is born of david’s line
a saviour who is christ the lord
and this shall be the sign

“the heav’nly babe you there shall find
to human view displayed
all meanly wrapped in swathing bands
and in a manger laid”


thus spake the seraph and forthwith
appeared a shining throng
of angels praising god who thus
addressed their joyful song

“all glory be to god on high
and to the earth be peace
goodwill henceforth from heav’n to earth
begin and never cease”



ascribe greatness
to our god the rock
his work is perfect
and all his ways are just

a god of faithfulness and
without injustice
good and upright is he
  ascribe greatness



i love you lord
and i lift my voice
to worship you
o my soul rejoice

take joy my king
in what you hear
may it be a sweet
sweet sound in your ear
i love you lord


’tis the hallowed hour of prayer
and we trustingly bring
all our doubting and our fears
to our saviour and king

a glad welcome to give
and the blessings that we ask for
we shall fully receive

a path though thorny bright
for god by grace shall dwell in thee

and cast a wishful eye
to canaan’s fair and happy land
where my possessions lie

i am bound for the promised land
i am bound for the promised land

for who aught to my charge shall lay
fully absolved through these i am
from sin and fear from guilt and shame
    
   
  
   

lord i believe thy precious blood
which at the mercy seat of god
forever doth for sinners plead
for me e’en for my soul was shed
    
  
   
  


lord i believe were sinners more
than sands upon the ocean shore
thou hast for all a ransom paid
for all a full atonement made

beyond the reach of toil and care
a home where changes never come
who would not fain be resting there

o wait meekly wait and murmur not
o wait o wait

by heav’n allowed thine earthly lot
look up thou’lt reach that blest abode

o wait meekly wait and murmur not
o wait meekly wait and murmur not
o wait o wait

one sigh unheard one prayer forgot
the day of rest will dawn for thee

o wait meekly wait and murmur not
o wait o wait

most blessed most glorious
the ancient of days
almighty victorious
thy great name we praise

and silent as light
nor wanting nor wasting
thou rulest in might

high soaring above
thy clouds which are fountains
of goodness and love
 
  
  
 

to all life thou givest
to both great and small
in all life thou livest
the true life of all
  
  
  
  

we blossom and flourish
as leaves on the tree
and wither and perish
but naught changeth thee

great father of glory
pure father of light
thine angels adore thee
all veiling their sight
  
   
  
 


all praise we would render
o help us to see
’tis only the splendour
of light hideth thee

when other helpers
fail and comforts flee

glories pass away
  
 
 
  

change and decay
in all around i see
o thou who changest not
abide with me

foil the tempter’s power

where is death’s sting
where grave thy victory
i triumph still if thou
abide with me
  
   
    
  

hold thou thy cross
before my closing eyes
shine through the gloom and
point me to the skies
  
   
 
  


heaven’s morning breaks
and earth’s vain shadows flee
in life in death o lord
abide with me
 
 
    
  


hark the voice of jesus calling
“who will go and work today
fields are ripe and harvests waiting
who will bear the sheaves away”
   
   
  
    
    

long and loud the master calls us
rich reward he offers free
who will answer gladly saying
“here am i send me send me”
  
   
   
   

if you cannot cross the ocean
and the distant lands explore
you can find the lost around you
you can help them at your door
  
   
      
  

if you cannot give your thousands
you can give the widow’s mite
what you truly give for jesus
will be precious in his sight
   
  
   
   

if you cannot speak like angels
if you cannot preach like paul
you can tell the love of jesus
you can say he died for all
  
   
   
    

if you cannot rouse the wicked
with the judgement’s dread alarms
you can lead the little children
to the saviour’s waiting arms
   
     
   
   

let none hear you idly saying
“there is nothing i can do”
while the lost of earth are dying
and the master calls for you
    
  
     
  


take the task he gives you gladly
let his work your pleasure be
answer quickly when he calls you
“here am i send me send me”

go bury thy sorrow the world hath its share
go bury it deeply go hide it with care
go think of it calmly when curtained by night
go tell it to jesus and all will be right
  
     
       
     
    

go tell it to jesus he knoweth thy grief
go tell it to jesus he’ll send thee relief
go gather the sunshine he sheds on the way
he’ll lighten thy burdengo weary one pray
     
     
     
     


hearts growing aweary with heavier woe
now droop ’mid the darknessgo comfort

go bury thy sorrow let others be blessed
go give them the sunshine tell jesus the rest
    
       
     
     


father let me dedicate
all this life to thee
in whatever worldly state
thou wilt have me be

not from sorrow pain or care
freedom dare i claim
this alone shall be my prayer
glorify thy name
  father let me dedicate


be glorified in me
be glorified
be glorified in me
be glorified

can a child presume to choose
where or how to live
can a father’s love refuse
all the best to give

let my glad heart while it sings
thee in all proclaim
and whate’er the future brings
glorify thy name


be glorified in me
be glorified
be glorified in me
be glorified

be glorified in me

in christ alone my hope is found
he is my light my strength my song
this cornerstone this solid ground
firm through the fiercest drought and storm

what heights of love what depths of peace
when fears are stilled when strivings cease
my comforter my all in all
here in the love of christ i stand
  in christ alone

in christ alonewho took on flesh
fullness of god in helpless babe
this gift of love and righteousness
scorned by the ones he came to save

till on the cross as jesus died
the wrath of god was satisfied
for ev’ry sin on him was laid
here in the death of christ i live

there in the ground his body lay
light of the world by darkness slain
then bursting forth in glorious day
up from the grave he rose again

and as he stands in victory
sin’s curse has lost its grip on me
for i am his and he is mine
bought with the precious blood of christ


no guilt in life no fear in death
this is the pow’r of christ in me
from life’s first cry to final breath
jesus commands my destiny

no pow’r of hell no scheme of man
can ever pluck me from his hand
till he returns or calls me home
here in the pow’r of christ i’ll stand


jesus is coming to earth again
what if it were today
coming in power and love to reign
what if it were today
   
    
   
    
   

coming to claim his chosen bride
all the redeemed and purified
over this whole earth scattered wide
what if it were today
    
   
   
   

glory glory
joy to my heart ’twill bring
glory glory
when we shall crown him king

 
   
 
   

glory glory
haste to prepare the way
glory glory
jesus will come some day
 
   
 
   

satan’s dominion will then be o’er
o that it were today
sorrow and sighing shall be no more
o that it were today
   
    
   
    

then shall the dead in christ arise
caught up to meet him in the skies
when shall these glories meet our eyes
what if it were today
   
    
   
   

glory glory
joy to my heart ’twill bring
glory glory
when we shall crown him king

 
   
 
   

glory glory
haste to prepare the way
glory glory
jesus will come some day
 
   
 
   

faithful and true would he find us here
if he should come today
watching in gladness and not in fear
if he should come today
    
  
   
   

signs of his coming multiply
morning light breaks in eastern sky
watch for the time is drawing nigh
what if it were today
   
   
     
   

glory glory
joy to my heart ’twill bring
glory glory
when we shall crown him king

 
   
 
   

glory glory
haste to prepare the way
glory glory
jesus will come some day
 
   
 
   



the splendour of the king
clothed in majesty
let all the earth rejoice
all the earth rejoice

he wraps himself in light
and darkness tries to hide
and trembles at his voice
and trembles at his voice
  the splendour of the king


how great is our god
sing with me
how great is our god
and all will see how great
how great is our god

and age to age he stands
and time is in his hands
beginning and the end

the god-head three-in-one
father spirit son
the lion and the lamb
the lion and the lamb


how great is our god
sing with me
how great is our god
and all will see how great

name above all names
worthy of all praise

safe in the arms of jesus
safe on his gentle breast
there by his love o’ershaded
sweetly my soul shall rest
   
   
   
    
    

hark ’tis the voice of angels
borne in a song to me
over the fields of glory
over the jasper sea
   
    
    
    

safe in the arms of jesus
safe on his gentle breast
there by his love o’ershaded
sweetly my soul shall rest

   
   
    
    

safe in the arms of jesus
safe from corroding care
safe from the world’s temptations
sin cannot harm me there
   
   
  
    

free from the blight of sorrow
free from my doubts and fears
only a few more trials
only a few more tears
   
  
    
  

safe in the arms of jesus
safe on his gentle breast
there by his love o’ershaded
sweetly my soul shall rest

   
   
    
    

jesus my heart’s dear refuge
jesus has died for me
firm on the rock of ages
ever my trust shall be
   
   
    
  

here let me wait with patience
wait till the night is o’er
wait till i see the morning
break on the golden shore
  
    
   
  


safe in the arms of jesus
safe on his gentle breast
there by his love o’ershaded
sweetly my soul shall rest

   
   
    
    




it’s your blood that cleanses me
it’s your blood that gives me life
it’s your blood that took my place
in redeeming sacrifice
and washes me whiter than the snow
than the snow
my jesus god’s precious sacrifice
it’s your blood


must jesus bear the cross alone
and all the world go free
no there’s a cross for everyone
and there’s a cross for me
    
     
    
   
   

how happy are the saints above
who once went sorrowing here
but now they taste unmingled love
and joy without a tear
   
  
    
  

the consecrated cross i’ll bear
till death shall set me free
and then go home my crown to wear
for there’s a crown for me
   
   
    
    

upon the crystal pavement down
at jesus’ piercd feet
joyful i’ll cast my golden crown
and his dear name repeat
   
  
    
   

o precious cross o glorious crown
o resurrection day
when christ the lord
from heav’n comes down
and bears my soul away
     ― 
   
    
    


i was sinking deep in sin
far from the peaceful shore
very deeply stained within
sinking to rise no more
     
   
    
  
  

but the master of the sea
heard my despairing cry
from the waters lifted me
now safe am i
   
  
    
  

love lifted me
love lifted me
when nothing else could help
love lifted me

 
 
   
 

all my heart to him i give
ever to him i’ll cling
in his blessed presence live
ever his praises sing
  
    
   
  

love so mighty and so true
merits my soul’s best songs
faithful loving service too
to him belongs
    
  
   
  

love lifted me
love lifted me
when nothing else could help
love lifted me

 
 
   
 

souls in danger look above
jesus completely saves
he will lift you by his love
out of the angry waves
 
  
  
  

he’s the master of the sea
billows his will obey
he your saviour wants to be
be saved today
     
  
    
  


love lifted me
love lifted me
when nothing else could help
love lifted me  

 
 
   
   


though i may speak with
the language of angels
and though i may fathom
all mysteries

see into the future
have faith that moves mountains
if i am without love
then what does it mean
  though i may speak



without love
it’s nothing at all
without love
without love
it’s nothing at all

and even if i gave
the poor my possessions
surrendered my body
and died for the cause

though highly respected
successful and gifted
if love was excluded
i’ve wasted it all



without love
it’s nothing at all
without love
without love
it’s nothing at all

and when we pass through the fire
nothing but love will survive


without love
it’s nothing at all
without love
without love
it’s nothing at all




and with you
jesus we see love
nothing but love will survive

heal me o lord
and i will be healed
save me and i will be saved

heal me o lord
and i will be healed
for you are the one i praise
you are the one i praise
  heal me o lord


o that i had a thousand voices
and with a thousand tongues could tell
of him in whom the earth rejoices
who does all things wisely and well
      
      
   
   
    

my grateful heart would then be free
to tell what god has done for me
     
       
o all you pow’rs that god implanted
arise and silence keep no more
put forth the strength that god has
granted
your noblest work is to adore
      
    
     
     

o soul and body join to raise
with heartfelt joy our maker’s praise
    
   

you forest leaves so green and tender
that dance for joy in summer air
you meadow grasses bright and slender
you flow’rs so wond’rous sweet so fair
   
  
    
     

you live to show god’s praise alone
with me now make his glory known
   
    
all creatures that have breath and
motion
that throng the earth the sea the sky
now join with me my heart’s devotion
help me to raise his praises high
    
   
    
    

my utmost pow’rs can ne’er aright
declare the wonders of god’s might
    
    
   
  
     
  

o father deign thou i beseech thee
to listen to my earthly lays
a nobler strain in heav’n shall reach thee
when i with angels hymn thy praise

    
    

and learn amid their choirs to sing
loud hallelujahs to my king


love divine all loves excelling
joy of heav’n to earth come down
fix in us thy humble dwelling
all thy faithful mercies crown
   
 
  
    
    

jesus thou art all compassion
pure unbounded love thou art
visit us with thy salvation
enter ev’ry trembling heart
   
  
    
   

breathe o breathe thy loving spirit
into ev’ry troubled breast
let us all in thee inherit
let us find thy promised rest
   
   
  
  

take away our bent to sinning
alpha and omega be
end of faith as its beginning
set our hearts at liberty
    
  
   
   

come almighty to deliver
let us all thy life receive
suddenly return and never
nevermore thy temples leave
   
   
  
   

thee we would be always blessing
serve thee as thy hosts above
pray and praise thee without ceasing
glory in thy perfect love
    
    
  
  

finish then thy new creation
pure and spotless let us be
let us see thy great salvation
perfectly restored in thee

“almost persuaded”
now to believe
“almost persuaded”
christ to receive

“almost persuaded”
turn not away
  
  
  
  

jesus invites you here
angels are lingering near
prayers rise from hearts so dear
o wanderer come
  
  
   
 

“almost persuaded”
harvest is past
“almost persuaded”
doom comes at last
  
 
  
 


“almost” cannot avail
“almost” is but to fail
sad sad that bitter wail
“almost” but lost
   
  
   
  


an open bible for the world

blest word of god send forth thy light
o’er every land and every sea
till all who wander in the night
are led to god and heaven by thee

    
    
    
   

where’er it goes its golden light
streaming as from an unveiled sun
shall dissipate the clouds of night
undo the work that sin has done
   
   
    
    

blest word of god send forth thy light
o’er every land and every sea
till all who wander in the night
are led to god and heaven by thee

    
    
    
   

it shows to men the father’s face
all radiant with forgiving love
and to the lost of adam’s race
proclaims sweet mercy from above
  
    
   
   

blest word of god send forth thy light
o’er every land and every sea
till all who wander in the night
are led to god and heaven by thee

    
    
    
   

it offers rest to weary hearts
it comforts those who sit in tears
to all who faint it strength imparts
and gilds with hope th’ eternal years

as news of your impending death
to your disciples broke
and lovingly you took the bread
and words of blessing spoke
-    
  
   
  ’  
  
the bread you broke and with these
words
distributed to all
“this is my bodytake and eat
partake of it all of you”
  
  
„      
  ”

and then o lord you took the cup
and prayed and then you said
“this is my bloodby it for sins
atonement will be made”
     
„   
  ”   
„    ”

“this is the covenant of blood
no other can there be
whene’er you do it do it in
remembrance friends of me”
„     
   
    
   ”

your blood we would remember lord
for us shed on the tree
your mutilated body too
o let us ever see
    
    
    
    


possess our thoughts that ever we
may seek the reason why
why you on calv’ry’s rugged cross
chose such a death to die
    
   
     
  


on a hill far away
stood an old rugged cross
the emblem of suffering and shame
and i love that old cross
where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain
  

      
    
      
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

     
    
      
     

oh that old rugged cross
so despised by the world
has a wondrous attraction for me
for the dear lamb of god left his glory above
to bear it to dark calvary
       
      
       
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

     
    
      
     

to the old rugged cross i will ever be true
it’s shame and reproach gladly bear
then he’ll call me some day
to my home far away
where his glory forever i’ll share
       
   
      
    


so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

     
    
      
     


i grieved my lord from day to day
i scorned his love so full and free
and though i wandered far away
my mother’s prayers have followed me
   
   
    
     
  

i’m coming home i’m coming home
to live my wasted life anew
for mother’s prayers have followed me
have followed me the whole world thro’

    
   
     
  

o’er desert wild o’er mountain high
a wanderer i chose to be
a wretched soul condemned to die
still mother’s prayers have followed me
     
     
  
  

i’m coming home i’m coming home
to live my wasted life anew
for mother’s prayers have followed me
have followed me the whole world thro’

    
   
     
  

he turned my darkness into light
this blessd christ of calvary
i’ll praise his name both day and night
that mother’s prayers have followed me
    
    
    
  


i’m coming home i’m coming home
to live my wasted life anew
for mother’s prayers have followed me
have followed me the whole world thro’

    
   
     
  


i love to think of the heavenly land
where white-robed angels are
where many a friend is gathered safe
from fear and toil and care
    
    
  
    
  

there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting there

  
  
  
   

i love to think of the heavenly land
where my redeemer reigns
where rapturous songs of triumph rise
in endless joyous strains
    
   
    
  

there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting there

  
  
  
   
i love to think of the heavenly land
the saints’ eternal home
where palms and robes and crowns
ne’er fade
and all our joys are one
    
  
    
  

there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting there

  
  
  
   

i love to think of the heavenly land
that promised land so fair
oh how my raptured spirit longs
to be forever there
    
   
   
   


there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting there

  
  
  
   


i know not why god’s wond’rous grace
to me he hath made known
nor why unworthy christ in love
redeemed me for his own
   
   
  
   
    

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

      
     
    
    

i know not how this saving faith
to me he did impart
nor how believing in his word
wrought peace within my heart
     
   
     
 

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

      
     
    
    

i know not how the spirit moves
convincing men of sin
revealing jesus through the word
creating faith in him
     
   
    
  

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

      
     
    
    

i know not what of good or ill
may be reserved for me
of weary ways or golden days
before his face i see
      
 
     
  

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

      
     
    
    

i know not when my lord may come
at night or noonday fair
nor if i’ll walk the vale with him
or meet him in the air
    
  
      
    


but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed

i am saved from sin
i have peace within

when i survey the wondrous cross
on which the prince of glory died
my richest gain i count but loss
and pour contempt on all my pride
   
   
     
   
   

forbid it lord that i should boast
save in the death of christ my god
all the vain things that charm me most
i sacrifice them to his blood
    
     
     
   

see from his head his hands his feet
sorrow and love flow mingled down
did e’er such love and sorrow meet
or thorns compose so rich a crown
   
     
   
   


were the whole realm of nature mine
that were a present far too small
love so amazing so divine
demands my soul my life my all

crown him with many crowns
the lamb upon his throne
hark how the heavenly anthem drowns
all music but its own
  
  
   
   
  

awake my soul and sing
of him who died for thee
and hail him as thy matchless king
through all eternity
   
   
 ―   
 ―   

crown him the lord of love
behold his hands and side
rich wounds yet visible above
in beauty glorified
  
  
    
    

no angel in the sky
can fully bear that sight
but downward bends his wondering eye
at mysteries so bright
  
   
   
     

crown him the lord of life
who triumphed o’er the grave
who rose victorious to the strife
for those he came to save
  
  
    
  

his glories now we sing
who died and rose on high
who died eternal life to bring
and lives that death may die
   
  ―   
     
    

crown him the lord of heaven
one with the father known
one with the spirit through him given
from yonder glorious throne

for thou hast died for me
thy praise and glory shall not fail
throughout eternity

alas and did my saviour bleed
and did my sovereign die
would he devote that sacred head
for sinners such as i
   
   
 
  
   

at the cross at the cross
where i first saw the light
and the burden of my heart rolled away
it was there by faith i received my sight
and now i am happy all the day

   
  
     
    
     


thy body slain sweet jesus thine
and bathed in its own blood
while the firm mark of wrath divine
his soul in anguish stood
   
   
    
  

at the cross at the cross
where i first saw the light
and the burden of my heart rolled away
it was there by faith i received my sight
and now i am happy all the day

   
  
     
    
     


well might the sun in darkness hide
and shut his glories in
when christ the mighty maker died
for man the creature’s sin
     
  
  
   

at the cross at the cross
where i first saw the light
and the burden of my heart rolled away
it was there by faith i received my sight
and now i am happy all the day

   
  
     
    
     


thus might i hide my blushing face
while his dear cross appears
dissolve my heart in thankfulness
and melt my eyes to tears
    
   
    
  

at the cross at the cross
where i first saw the light
and the burden of my heart rolled away
it was there by faith i received my sight
and now i am happy all the day

   
  
     
    
     


but drops of grief can ne’er repay
the debt of love i owe
here lord i give my self away
’tis all that i can do
     
   
    
   


at the cross at the cross

when i look down from lofty mountain grandeur
and hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze

and take me home what joy shall fill my heart
then i shall bow in humble adoration
and there proclaim “my god
how great thou art”

in the footsteps of christians who died
  
  
   
    
   

homeward bound homeward bound
from a world where deceptions abound
i escape and i run
to the land of the ne’er-setting sun

as i travel this vale full of tears
yet my trust in the lord wavers not
in his presence i’ll rest from all fears

from a world where deceptions abound

and forever forget all our woes

from care he sets me free

and i know he watches me

still still with thee when purple morning
breaketh
when the bird waketh and the shadows flee
fairer than morning lovelier than daylight
dawns the sweet consciousness i am with thee
  
    
 
    
      
     

alone with thee amid the mystic shadows
the solemn hush of nature newly born
alone with thee in breathless adoration
in the calm dew and freshness of the morn
     
     
     
      

still still with thee as to each newborn morning
a fresh and solemn splendour still is given
so does this blessd consciousness awaking
breath each day nearness unto thee
and heaven
    
     
    
     


so shall it be at last in that bright morning
when the soul waketh and life’s shadows flee
o in that hour fairer than daylight dawning
shall rise the glorious thought i am with thee

as news of your impending death
to your disciples broke
and lovingly you took the bread
and words of blessing spoke
  
  
   
     
  
the bread you broke and with these
words
distributed to all
“this is my bodytake and eat
partake of it all of you”
    
   
   
   

and then o lord you took the cup
and prayed and then you said
“this is my bloodby it for sins
atonement will be made”
     
    
     
   

“this is the covenant of blood
no other can there be
whene’er you do it do it in

your blood we would remember lord
for us shed on the tree
your mutilated body too
o let us ever see
     
  
  
    


possess our thoughts that ever we
may seek the reason why
why you on calv’ry’s rugged cross
chose such a death to die
     
    
     
  


i gave my life for thee
my precious blood i shed
that thou might’st ransomed be
and quickened from the dead

i gave i gave my life for thee
what hast thou giv’n for me
i gave i gave my life for thee
what hast thou giv’n for me
   
    
   
    

my father’s house of light
my glory-circled throne
i left for earthly night
for wand’rings sad and lone
   
   
    
   

i left i left it all for thee
hast thou left aught for me
i left i left it all for thee
hast thou left aught for me
    
    
    
    

i suffered much for thee
more than thy tongue can tell
of bitt’rest agony
to rescue thee from hell
  
   
  
  

i’ve borne i’ve borne it all for thee
what hast thou borne for me
i’ve borne i’ve borne it all for thee
what hast thou borne for me
    
    
    
    

and i have brought to thee
down from my home above
salvation full and free
my pardon and my love
  
  
   
  

i bring i bring rich gifts to thee
what hast thou brought to me
i bring i bring rich gifts to thee
what hast thou brought to me

lord of harvest send forth reapers
hear us lord to thee we cry
send them now the sheaves to gather
ere the harvest time pass by

beaming

when the sun’s last rays are gleaming
bid them gather everywhere

come thou fount of every blessing
tune my heart to sing thy grace
streams of mercy never ceasing
call for songs of loudest praise
   
   
     
   
   

teach me some melodious sonnet
sung by flaming tongues above
praise the mount i’m fixed upon it
mount of god’s unchanging love
    
   
  
  

here i raise my ebenezer
hither by thy help i come
and i hope by thy good pleasure
safely to arrive at home
   -
   
     
    

jesus sought me when a stranger
wand’ring from the fold of god
he to rescue me from danger
interposed his precious blood
    
   
  
  

oh to grace how great a debtor
daily i’m constrained to be
let thy grace lord like a fetter
bind my wand’ring heart to thee
   
   
  
   


prone to wander lord i feel it
prone to leave the god i love
here’s my heart lord take and seal it
seal it for thy courts above
   
   
   
  


at even ere the sun was set
the sick o lord around thee lay
o with how many pains they met
o with what joy they went away
  
     
   
   
  

once more ’tis eventide and we
oppressed with various ills draw near
what if thyself we cannot see
we know that thou art ever near
     
    
    
     

o saviour christ our woes dispel
for some are sick and some are sad
and some have never loved thee well
and some have lost the love they had
   
    
   
    

o saviour christ thou too art man
thou has been troubled tempted tried
thy kind but searching glance can scan
the very wounds that shame would hide
     
    
   
     


thy touch has still its ancient power
no word from thee can fruitless fall
hear in this solemn evening hour
and in thy mercy heal us all

“it is well it is well with my soul”
   
     
    
    
    


it is well it is well
with my soul with my soul

though trials should come
let blessed assurance control
that christ hath regarded my helpless estate
and has shed his own blood for my soul
     
   
      
   


it is well it is well
with my soul with my soul
it is well it is well with my soul

     
   
    

my sin o the bliss of this glorious thought

it is well it is well
with my soul with my soul
it is well it is well with my soul

     
   
    

for me be it christ be it christ hence to live
if jordan above me shall roll
no pang shall be mine for in death as in life
thou wilt whisper thy peace to my soul
       
     
     
    


it is well it is well
with my soul with my soul

o lord haste the day when my faith
shall be sight
the clouds be rolled back as a scroll
the trump shall resound and the lord
shall descend
“even so” it is well with my soul
    
   
      
    



it is well it is well
with my soul with my soul
it is well it is well with my soul

and causes all his saints
to cry out glory


glory to the lord worship him
the god of our salvation
glory to the lord honour him
he reigns he rules the nations

he is righteous and worthy
to be worshipped and adored
lift your voices and give
glory to the lord


on a hill far away
stood an old rugged cross
the emblem of suffering and shame
and i love that old cross
where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain
-    

      
     
      
      

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

     
    
     
     

oh that old rugged cross
so despised by the world
has a wondrous attraction for me
for the dear lamb of god left his glory above
to bear it to dark calvary
      

     
       

     

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

     
    
     
     
in that old rugged cross
stained with blood so divine
a wondrous beauty i see
for ’twas on that old cross
jesus suffered and died
to pardon and sanctify me
       
    
      
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

     
    
     
     

to the old rugged cross i will ever be true
it’s shame and reproach gladly bear
then he’ll call me some day
to my home far away
where his glory forever i’ll share
     
     
       
      


so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

o holy night the stars are brightly shining

long lay the world in sin and error pining
till he appeared and the soul felt its worth
 
    
     
      
     

a thrill of hope the weary soul rejoices
for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
fall on your knees o hear the angel voices
o night divine o night when christ was born

here came the wise men from orient land
    
       
    
      
the king of kings lay thus in lowly manger
in all our trials born to be our friend
he knows our needto our weakness is
no stranger
behold your king before him lowly bend
behold your king before him lowly bend

his law is love and his gospel is peace
chains shall he break for the slave is
our brother
and in his name all oppression shall cease
     
       
     
     


sweet hymns of joy in grateful  raise we
let all within us praise his holy name

come holy spirit heavenly dove
with all thy quick’ning powers
kindle a flame of sacred love
in these cold hearts of ours
   
     
  
    
  

in vain we tune our formal songs
in vain we strive to rise
hosannas languish on our tongues
and our devotion dies
   
  
     
  

dear lord and shall we ever live
at this poor dying rate
our love so faint so cold to thee
and thine to us so great
   
   
     
    


come holy spirit heavenly dove
with all thy quick’ning powers
come shed abroad the saviour’s love
and that shall kindle ours
     
   
    
   


o worship the king all glorious above
and gratefully sing his pow’r and his love
our shield and defender the ancient of days
pavilioned in splendour and girded with praise
    
   
      
     
   
o tell of his might and sing of his grace
whose robe is the light whose canopy space
his chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds
form
and dark is his path on the wings of the storm
    
      
      
   
thy bountiful care what tongue can recite
it breathes in the air it shines in the light
it streams from the hills it descends to
the plain
and sweetly distils in the dew and the rain
    
      
       
     


frail children of dust and feeble as frail
in thee do we trust nor find thee to fail
thy mercies how tender how firm to the end
our maker defender redeemer and friend

a mighty fortress is our god
a bulwark never failing
our helper he amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing
    
    
    
     
    
for still our ancient foe
doth seek to work us woe
his craft and power are great
and armed with cruel hate
on earth is not his equal
    
  
   
   
    

did we in our own strength confide
our striving would be losing
were not the right man on our side
the man of god’s own choosing
   
  
    
  
dost ask who that may be
christ jesus it is he
lord sabaoth his name
from age to age the same
and he must win the battle
   
  
    
       
 

and though this world with devils filled
should threaten to undo us
we will not fear for god hath willed
his truth to triumph through us
   
   
   
  
the prince of darkness grim
we tremble not for him
his rage we can endure
for lo his doom is sure
one little word shall fell him
    
   
   
   
  

that word above all earthly powers
no thanks to them abideth
the spirit and the gifts are ours
through him who with us sideth
  
   
   
 

let goods and kindred go
this mortal life also
the body they may kill
god’s truth abideth still
his kingdom is forever

when i was but a little child
how well i recollect
how i would grieve my mother
with my folly and neglect
    
    
  
    
  

and now that she has gone to heav’n
i miss her tender care
o saviour tell my mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there
    
   
  
     

tell mother i’ll be there
in answer to her prayer
this message blessd saviour
to her bear

   
  
 
  

tell mother i’ll be there
heav’n’s joys with her to share
yes tell my darling mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there
   
     
  
     

though i was often wayward
she was always kind and good
so patient gentle loving
when i acted rough and rude
   
    
    
  

my childhood griefs and trials
she would gladly with me share
o saviour tell my mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there
   
 
  
     

tell mother i’ll be there
in answer to her prayer
this message blessd saviour
to her bear

   
  
 
  

tell mother i’ll be there
heav’n’s joys with her to share
yes tell my darling mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there
   
     
  
     

when i became a prodigal
and left the old roof-tree
she almost broke her loving heart
in mourning after me
    
    
   
   

and day and night she prayed to god
to keep me in his care
o saviour tell my mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there
     
   
  
     

tell mother i’ll be there
in answer to her prayer
this message blessd saviour
to her bear

   
  
 
  

tell mother i’ll be there
heav’n’s joys with her to share
yes tell my darling mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there
   
     
  
     

one day a message came to me
it bade me quickly come
if i would see my mother
ere the saviour took her home
    
   
   
   

i promised her before she died
for heaven to prepare
o saviour tell my mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there

sweet mercies flow from heaven
new mercies for today
o shower them down lord
as we pray

the peace the joy i sought so long

there’s a church in the valley
by the wildwood
no lovelier spot in the dale
no place is so dear to my childhood
as the little brown church in the vale
-     

    
     
     
  

come to the church in the wildwood
oh come to the church in the vale
no spot is so dear to my childhood
as the little brown church in the vale

     
     
   
   

how sweet on a clear sabbath morning
to list’n to the clear ringing bell
its tones so sweetly are calling
oh come to the church in the vale
   
    
   
   

come to the church in the wildwood
oh come to the church in the vale
no spot is so dear to my childhood
as the little brown church in the vale

     
     
   
   
there close by the church in the valley
lies one that i loved so well
she sleeps sweetly sleeps ’neath
the willow
disturb not her rest in the vale
      
    
   
    

come to the church in the wildwood
oh come to the church in the vale
no spot is so dear to my childhood
as the little brown church in the vale

     
     
   
   
there close by the side of that loved one
to the trees where the wild flowers
bloom
where the farewell hymn will be chanted
i shall rest by her side in the tomb
   
    
   
 ―   

come to the church in the wildwood
oh come to the church in the vale
no spot is so dear to my childhood
as the little brown church in the vale

     
     
   
   
from the church in the valley
by the wildwood
when day fades away into night
i would fain from this spot of my
childhood
wing my way to the mansions of light

    
    
  
    


come to the church in the wildwood
oh come to the church in the vale
no spot is so dear to my childhood
as the little brown church in the vale

     
     
   
   



i enter the holy of holies
i enter through the blood of the lamb
i enter to worship you only
i enter to honour “i am”

lord i worship you i worship you
lord i worship you i worship you
for your name is holy holy lord
for your name is holy holy lord

i come to the garden alone
while the dew is still on the roses
and the voice i hear falling on my ear
the son of god discloses
     
     
   
       
   

and he walks with me
and he talks with me
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known

      
  
      
   


he speaks and the sound of his voice
is so sweet the birds hush their singing
and the melody that he gave to me
within my heart is ringing
    
  
     
    

and he walks with me
and he talks with me
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known

      
  
      
   

i’d stay in the garden with him
though the night around me be falling
but he bids me go through the
voice of woe
his voice to me is calling
    
   
       
   


and he walks with me
and he talks with me
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known

      
  
      
   


it came upon the midnight clear
that glorious song of old
from angels bending near the earth
to touch their harps of gold
  
    
   
   
   

“peace on the earth good will to men
from heaven’s all-gracious king”
the world in solemn stillness lay
to hear the angels sing
    
  
    
  

still thro’ the cloven skies they come
with peaceful wings unfurled
and still their heavenly music floats
o’er all the weary world
   
  
     
  

above its sad and lowly plains
they bend on hovering wing
and ever o’er its babel sounds
the blessed angels sing
     
   
   
  

and ye beneath life’s crushing load
whose forms are bending low
who toil along the climbing way
with painful steps and slow
    
 
   
  

look now for glad and golden hours
come swiftly on the wing
o rest beside the weary road
and hear the angels sing
   
  
    
  

for lo the days are hastening on
by prophet bards foretold
when with the ever-circling years
comes round the age of gold
   
 
    
  


when peace shall over all the earth
its ancient splendours fling
and the whole world give back the song
which now the angels sing
   
  
    
   


i need thee ev’ry hour
most gracious lord
no tender voice like thine
can peace afford
    
    
  
   
  

i need thee o i need thee
ev’ry hour i need thee
o bless me now my saviour
i come to thee

   
    
   
  

i need thee ev’ry hour
stay thou near by
temptations lose their power
when thou art nigh
    
 
  
 

i need thee o i need thee
ev’ry hour i need thee
o bless me now my saviour
i come to thee

   
    
   
  

i need thee ev’ry hour
in joy or pain
come quickly and abide
or life is vain
    
 
   
  

i need thee o i need thee
ev’ry hour i need thee
o bless me now my saviour
i come to thee

   
    
   
  

i need thee ev’ry hour
teach me thy will
and thy rich promises
in me fulfil
    
 
   
 

i need thee o i need thee
ev’ry hour i need thee
o bless me now my saviour
i come to thee

   
    
   
  

i need thee ev’ry hour
most holy one
oh make me thine indeed
thou blessed son
    
   
   
 


i need thee o i need thee
ev’ry hour i need thee
o bless me now my saviour
i come to thee

he lives within my heart
   
 
    
    


o boundless salvation deep ocean of love
o fullness of mercy christ brought from above
the whole world redeeming so rich and so free
now flowing for all men
come roll over me
-    
    
     
       
   
  

my sins they are many their stains are so deep
and bitter the tears of remorse that i weep
but useless is weeping thou great crimson sea
thy waters can cleanse me
come roll over me
       
     
      
  
  
my tempers are fitful my passions are strong
they bind my poor soul and they force
me to wrong
beneath thy blest billows deliverance i see
o come mighty ocean
and roll over me
     
     
     
   
   

the tide is now flowing i’m touching the wave
i hear the loud call of the mighty to save
my faith’s growing bolder delivered i’ll be
i plunge ’neath the waters
they roll over me
  ’   
’      
     ’   
   
  


and now hallelujah the rest of my days
shall gladly be spent in promoting his praise
who opened his bosom to pour out this sea
of boundless salvation
for you and for me

when sunlight through darkness
and shadow is breaking
that jesus will come in the fullness of glory
to receive from the world “his own”

o lord jesus how long
how long ere we shout the glad song

o little town of bethlehem
how still we see thee lie
above thy deep and dreamless sleep
the silent stars go by
   
   
   
   
  

yet in thy dark streets shineth
the everlasting light
the hopes and fears of all the years
are met in thee tonight
  
  
   
   

for christ is born of mary
and gathered all above
while mortals sleep the angels keep
their watch of wondering love
    
    
      
 

o morning stars together
proclaim the holy birth
and praises sing to god the king
and peace to men on earth
    
   
     
   

how silently how silently
the wondrous gift is giv’n
so god imparts to human hearts
the blessings of his heaven
    
    
   
   

no ear may hear his coming
but in this world of sin
where meek souls will receive him still
the dear christ enters in
  
    
    
 

o holy child of bethlehem
descend to us we pray
cast out our sin and enter in
be born in us today

the great glad tidings tell

though troubles assail us
and dangers affright
though friends should all fail us

yet one thing secures us
whatever betide
the promise assures us
“the lord will provide”

from them let us learn to
trust god for our bread

“the lord will provide”

to stop up our path
and courage all fails us
we triumph by faith
 
  
  
  

he cannot take from us
though oft he has tried
this heart-cheering promise
“the lord will provide”
  
 
  
 

no strength of our own
and no goodness we claim
yet since we have known
of the saviour’s great name
  
    
  
  


in this our strong tower
for safety we hide
the lord is our power
“the lord will provide”

i have placed all my hope
in a crucified man
in the wounds in his side
his feet and his hands

i have traded my pride
for a share in his shame
and the glory that one day
will burst from his pain
  i have placed all my hope

i’ve abandoned my trust
in the wise and the proud
for this fragile mysterious
weakness of god

and i dare to believe
in his scandalous claim
that his blood cleanses sin
for whoever will call on his name



live or die here i stand
i’ve placed my hope
in a crucified man

i believe as they beat
on his beautiful face
he turned a torturer’s chair
to an altar of grace

where the worst we can do
met the best that god does
where unspeakable hate
met the gaze of unstoppable love



at the crux of it all there he hangs
i’ve placed my hope in a crucified
man of sorrows man of grief
will he stay beyond belief

when the purest and best
took the force of our curse
death’s vict’ry armada
juddered into reverse

and either we bow
or we stumble and fall
for the wisdom of a suffering god
has made fools of us all



i gladly admit that i am
but i’ve placed my hope in a crucified
man of sorrows man of grief
will he stay beyond belief

i have buried my life
in the cold earth with him
like a seed in the winter
i wait for the spring

from that garden of tombs
eden rises again
and paradise blooms
from his body and never will end



he’ll finish all he began
creation hopes
in a crucified man


when i stand at the judgement
i have no other plan
i’ve placed my hope
in a crucified man

like the thief nailed beside him
i have no other plan
i’ve placed my hope
in a crucified man

i belong to the king
i’m a child of his love
i shall dwell in his palace so fair
for he tells of its bliss
in yon heaven above
and his children in splendour shall share
  

  
   
      
  
  
    

i belong to the king i’m a child of his love
and he never forsaketh his own
he will call me some day to his palace above
i shall dwell by his glorified throne

  
   
    
     
    
     
i belong to the king
and he loves me i know
for his mercy and kindness so free
are unceasingly mine
wheresoever i go
and my refuge unfailing is he

  
  
     
 
      
       

i belong to the king i’m a child of his love
and he never forsaketh his own
he will call me some day to his palace above
i shall dwell by his glorified throne

  
   
    
     
    
     
i belong to the king
and his promise is sure
that we all shall be gathered at last
in his kingdom above
by life’s waters so pure
when this life with its trials is past

  
  
      
  
   
    


i belong to the king i’m a child of his love
and he never forsaketh his own

on mary’s lap is sleeping
whom angels greet with anthems sweet
while shepherds watch are keeping
     
     
 
    
  

this this is christ the king
whom shepherds guard and angels sing
haste haste to bring him laud
the babe the son of mary
   
     
   
  

why lies he in such mean estate
where ox and ass are feeding
good christian fear for sinners here
the silent word is pleading
     
   
     
  

nails spear shall pierce him thro’
the cross be borne for me for you
hail hail the word made flesh
the babe the son of mary
   
     
   
  

so bring him incense gold and myrrh
come peasant king to own him
the king of kings salvation brings
let loving hearts enthrone him
    
  
      
  


raise raise the song on high
the virgin sings her lullaby
joy joy for christ is born

o god our help in ages past
our hope for years to come
our shelter from the stormy blast
and our eternal home
    
      
   
    
   

under the shadow of thy throne
still may we dwell secure
sufficient is thine arm alone
and our defence is sure
    
 
  
   

before the hills in order stood
or earth received her frame
from everlasting thou art god
to endless years the same
  
   
    
      

a thousand ages in thy sight
are like an evening gone
short as the watch that ends the night
before the rising sun
    
  
     
  

time like an ever rolling stream
bears all its sons away
they fly forgotten as a dream
dies at the opening day
  
   
    
    


o god our help in ages past
our hope for years to come
be thou my guide while life shall last
and our eternal home

when thou camest to earth for me
but in bethlehem’s home
was there found no room
for thy holy nativity
  

      
   
      
   


o come to my heart lord jesus

there is room in my heart for thee

      
     

thou camest o lord with the living word
that should set thy people free
but with mocking scorn and with crown of thorn
they bore thee to calvary
     
   
     
   


o come to my heart lord jesus
there is room in my heart for thee

      
     

when the heavens shall ring and the angels sing
at thy coming to victory
let thy voice call me home
saying “yet there is room
there is room at my side for thee”
    
     
     
     



and my heart shall rejoice lord jesus
when thou comest and callest me

      
     


god moves in a mysterious way
his wonders to perform
he plants his footsteps in the sea
and rides upon the storm
    
  
  
   
     

deep in unfathomable mines
of never-failing skill
he treasures up his bright designs
and works his sovereign will
  
   
     
   

ye fearful saints fresh courage take
the clouds ye so much dread
are big with mercy and shall break
in blessings on your head
   
 
   
  

judge not the lord by feeble sense
but trust him for his grace
behind a frowning providence
he hides a smiling face
  
  
  
  

his purposes will ripen fast
unfolding every hour
the bud may have a bitter taste
but sweet will be the flower
  
   
   
    


blind unbelief is sure to err
and scan his work in vain
god is his own interpreter
and he will make it plain
    
    
    
 


o lord you’re beautiful
your face is all i seek
for when your eyes are on this child
your grace abounds to me

o lord please light the fire
that once burned bright and clear
replace the lamp of my first love
that burns with holy fear
o lord you’re beautiful


i wanna take your word
and shine it all around
but first help me just to live it lord
and when i’m doing well
help me to never seek a crown
for my reward is giving glory to you



o lord you’re beautiful
your face is all i seek
for when your eyes are on this child
your grace abounds to me


the church’s one foundation
is jesus christ her lord
she is his new creation
by water and the word
   
   
    
  
 

from heav’n he came and sought her
to be his holy bride
with his own blood he bought her
and for her life he died
    
   
  
   

she is from ev’ry nation
yet one o’er all the earth
her charter of salvation
one lord one faith one birth
 
  
  
 

one holy name she blesses
partakes one holy food
and to one hope she presses
with ev’ry grace endued
  
  
  
  

though with a scornful wonder
men see her sore oppressed
by schisms rent asunder
by heresies distressed
 
 
  
 

yet saints their watch are keeping
their cry goes up “how long”
and soon the night of weeping
shall be the morn of song
   
   
  
  

’mid toil and tribulation
and tumult of her war
she waits the consummation
of peace forevermore
   
   
  
  

till with the vision glorious
her longing eyes are blest
and the great church victorious
shall be the church at rest
  
  
  
 

yet she on earth hath union
with god the three in one
and mystic sweet communion
with those whose rest is won
    
    
  
 


with all her sons and daughters
who by the master’s hand
led through the deathly waters
repose in eden land

years i spent in vanity and pride
caring not my lord was crucified
knowing not it was for me he died
on calvary
    
    
      
    
  

mercy there was great and grace was free
pardon there was multiplied to me
there my burdened soul found liberty
at calvary

   
    
   
  

by god’s word at last my sin i learned
then i trembled at the law i’d spurned
till my guilty soul imploring turned
to calvary
    
    
    
  

mercy there was great and grace was free
pardon there was multiplied to me
there my burdened soul found liberty
at calvary

   
    
   
  

now i’ve giv’n to jesus ev’rything
now i gladly own him as my king
now my raptured soul can only sing
of calvary
   
      
   
  

mercy there was great and grace was free
pardon there was multiplied to me
there my burdened soul found liberty
at calvary

   
    
   
  

o the love that drew salvation’s plan
o the grace that brought it down to man
o the mighty gulf that god did span
at calvary
    
   
   
  


mercy there was great and grace was free
pardon there was multiplied to me
there my burdened soul found liberty
at calvary

   
    
   
  


as sure as jesus lives
to me his strength he gives
then fear anxiety will go
my heart with faith o’erflow
  
  
  
   
  

he is the shepherd true
his sheep he leadeth too
to pleasant pastures guideth me
to waters fresh and sweet
   
   
     
   

and when the sunlight fades
the darkness me o’ershades
i know that jesus through the night
will guard me with his might
   
   
    
   

yes if my faith should fail
the enemy prevail
then to the saviour’s heart i’ll flee
to find a remedy
   
 
    
   


now unto him i look
my burden to him take
oh jesus loves me tenderly
this will my comfort be

the son of god goes forth to war
a kingly crown to gain
his blood-red banner streams afar
who follows in his train
    
    
  
    
   

who best can drink his cup of woe
triumphant over pain
who patient bears his cross below
he follows in his train
    
 
   
   

that martyr first whose eagle eye
could pierce beyond the grave
who saw his master in the sky
and called on him to save
    
  
   
   

like him with pardon on his tongue
in midst of mortal pain
he prayed for them that did the wrong
who follows in his train
  
  
    
   
a glorious band the chosen few
on whom the spirit came
twelve valiant saints their hope they
knew
and mocked the cross and flame

through peril toil and pain
o god to us may grace be given
to follow in their train
   
  
    
   


my lord has garments so wondrous fine
and myrrh their texture fills
its fragrance reached to this heart of mine
with joy my being thrills
 
   
  
    
    

out of the ivory palaces
into a world of woe
only his great eternal love
made my saviour go

   
    
    
  

his life had also its sorrows sore
for aloes had a part
and when i think of the cross he bore
my eyes with tear-drops start
   
   
    
   

out of the ivory palaces
into a world of woe
only his great eternal love
made my saviour go

   
    
    
  
his garments too were in cassia dipped
with healing in a touch
each time my feet in some sin
have slipped
he took me from its clutch
   
 
    
   

out of the ivory palaces
into a world of woe
only his great eternal love
made my saviour go

   
    
    
  

in garments glorious he will come
to open wide the door
and i shall enter my heav’nly home
to dwell forevermore
    
   
     
    


out of the ivory palaces
into a world of woe
only his great eternal love
made my saviour go

because i know he holds my future
and life is worth the living
just because he lives


how sweet to hold a newborn baby
and feel the pride and joy he gives
but greater still the calm assurance
this child can face uncertain days
because he lives



because he lives i can face tomorrow
because he lives all fear is gone
because i know he holds my future
and life is worth the living
just because he lives


and then one day i’ll cross the river
i’ll fight life’s final war with pain
and then as death gives way to vict’ry
i’ll see the lights of glory
and i’ll know he reigns




because he lives i can face tomorrow
because he lives all fear is gone
because i know he holds my future
and life is worth the living
just because he lives

not to be served but to serve
and give your life that we might live


this is our god the servant king
he calls us now to follow him

my heavy load he chose to bear
his heart with sorrow was torn
“yet not my will but yours” he said


this is our god the servant king

the first nol the angel did say
was to certain poor shepherds
in fields as they lay
in fields where they lay keeping their sheep
on a cold winter’s night that was so deep
   
   
   
   
    


nol nol nol nol
born is the king of israel

   
     

they lookd up and saw a star
shining in the east beyond them far
and to the earth it gave great light
and so it continued both day and night
   
   
    
    


nol nol nol nol
born is the king of israel

   
     

and by the light of that same star
three wise men came from country far
to seek for a king was their intent
and to follow the star wherever it went
   
  
  
     


nol nol nol nol
born is the king of israel

   
     

then did they know assuredly
within that house the king did lie
one entered it them for to see
and found the babe in poverty
     
    
     
  


nol nol nol nol
born is the king of israel

   
     

then entered in those wise men three
full reverently upon the knee
and offered there in his presence
their gold and myrrh and frankincense

all promise all fulfilment
and end of mystery
  
  
   
   
  

lamenting or rejoicing
with doubt or terror nigh
i hear the “come” of jesus

come oh come to me
come oh come to me
weary heavy-laden
come oh come to me  

   
   
 
     

o soul why shouldst thou wander
from such a loving friend
cling closer closer to him
stay with him to the end
 
  
   
  

alas i am so helpless
so very full of sin
for i am ever wand’ring
and coming back again
  
 
  
    

come oh come to me

weary heavy-laden
come oh come to me  

   
   
 
     

o each time draw me nearer
that soon the “come” may be
naught but a gentle whisper
to one close close to thee
    
   
     
  

then over sea and mountain
far from or near my home
i’ll take thy hand and follow
at that sweet whisper “come”
    
    
   
  


come oh come to me
come oh come to me
weary heavy-laden
come oh come to me  

   
   
 
     



you shine
brighter than the brightest star
your love
purer than the purest heart

you shine
filling us with courage and strength
to follow you
  you shine
why should i fear man
when you made the heavens
why should i be afraid
when you put the stars in place
why should i lose heart
when i know how great you are
why should i give up
when your plans are full of love

in this world we will have trouble
but you have overcome the world



you shine
brighter than the brightest star
your love
purer than the purest heart

you are the stone
that the builders rejected
a rock of refuge
where my pride is broken

a sure foundation
when the sand is sinking
where we are built upon
like living stones
  you are the stone



there is no one else like you
there is no one like you lord
there is no one else like you
son of man and son of god
son of man and son of god

when from the cross
you to the depths descended
the host of hell conspired
to make you captive

but ev’ry chain of sin
and death you’ve broken
are triumphed over
by your mighty power



there is no one else like you
there is no one like you lord
there is no one else like you
son of man and son of god
son of man and son of god

i want to run
the race you’ve set before me
even to share
in the suff’ring of the cross
that i might gain
the prize for which you called me
to be with you son of man
and son of god
to be with you son of man
and son of god

then from the earth
you to the heights ascended
where you are seated
at your father’s right hand

forever pleading
for the souls you’ve captured
forever watching
as you call us home



there is no one else like you
there is no one like you lord
there is no one else like you
son of man and son of god
son of man and son of god
son of man and son of god


brightly beams our father’s mercy
from his lighthouse evermore
but to us he gives the keeping
of the lights along the shore
    
    
  
    
  

let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
for to us he gives the keeping
of the lights along the shore

     
   
  
   

dark the night of sin has settled
loud the angry billows roar
eager eyes are watching longing
for the lights along the shore
    
   
  
    

let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
eager eyes are watching longing
for the lights along the shore

     
   
  
   

trim your feeble lamp my brother
some poor sailor tempest tossed
trying now to make the harbour
in the darkness may be lost
   
   
   
  


let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
trying now to make the harbour
some poor sailor may be lost

dear lord and father of mankind
forgive our foolish ways
reclothe us in our rightful mind
in purer lives thy service find
in deeper reverence praise
   
   
   
    
   
  

in simple trust like theirs who heard
beside the syrian sea
the gracious calling of the lord
let us like them without a word
rise up and follow thee
     
  
    
    
   

drop thy still dews of quietness
till all our strivings cease
take from our souls the strain and stress
and let our ordered lives confess
the beauty of thy peace
  
   
   
    
   

breathe through the heats of our desire
thy coolness and thy balm
let sense be dumb let flesh retire
speak through the earthquake wind
and fire
o still small voice of calm
  
 
   
    
   


you are most worthy o lord our god
you are most worthy o lord our god
you are most worthy o lord our god
worthy are you

to receive glory and honour and praise
to receive glory and honour and praise
worthy are you

thy holy spirit lord alone
can turn our hearts from sin
his power alone can sanctify
and keep us pure within
   
    
  
     
   

thy holy spirit lord alone
can deeper love inspire
his power alone within our souls
can light the sacred fire
     
 
    
   

thy holy spirit lord can bring
the gifts we seek in prayer
his voice can words of comfort speak
and still each wave of care
    
   
   
  


thy holy spirit lord can give
the grace we need this hour
and while we wait o spirit come
in sanctifying power
    
 
     
  


in a mock purple arrayed
with thorns piercing thy brow
with hands bound taken out of the city
   
   
  e
   

thy face showing the suff’ring
which thou didst allow
also for your tormentorswhat pity

  
  
     


but thy suff’ring transcends
the mere physical lord
although thou art in dire situation
    
 
   

greater far is the
spiritual suff’ring endured
knowing they would reject thy salvation

    
 
     


thy compassion o lord
reaches out to thy foes
thy heart for them is o’erfilling
  
 
    

they do not understand
to thee their hearts are closed
but thy prophecy they are fulfilling

   
 
     


“bring the sceptre to him
on your knees everyone
live forever o king”moods
are wors’ning
  
   
   


and now into thy hand
o thou god’s only son
they the reed of bulrushes are forcing

   
  
  


with the reeds they beat down
on the sharp thorny crown
and slaps on thy gaunt cheeks
follow after
  
  
    

and the blood from thy forehead
is now trickling down
all the more they are engulfed with
laughter
   
   
    

   
 
    

    
  
     



yield not to temptation
for yielding is sin
each vict’ry will help you
some other to win
   
   
   
 
 

fight manfully onward
dark passions subdue
look ever to jesus
he will carry you through
  
   
   
  

ask the saviour to help you
comfort strengthen and keep you
he is willing to aid you
he will carry you through

   
   
   
  

shun evil companions
bad language disdain
god’s name hold in rev’rence
nor take it in vain
   
   
  
 

be thoughtful and earnest
kind-hearted and true
look ever to jesus
he will carry you through
  
   
   
  

ask the saviour to help you
comfort strengthen and keep you
he is willing to aid you
he will carry you through

   
   
   
  

to him to o’ercometh
god giveth a crown
thro’ faith we shall conquer
though often cast down
  
 
  
  

he who is our saviour
our strength will renew
look ever to jesus
he will carry you through
  
 
   
  


ask the saviour to help you
comfort strengthen and keep you

brightest and best of the sons of the morning
dawn on our darkness and lend us thine aid
star of the east the horizon adorning
guide where our infant redeemer is laid
  
     
    
     
    

cold on his cradle the dewdrops are shining
low lies his head with the beasts of the stall
angels adore him in slumber reclining
maker and monarch and saviour of all
    
    
     
    

say shall we yield him in costly devotion
odours of edom and offerings divine
gems of the mountain and pearls of the ocean
myrrh from the forest or gold from the mine
      
   
   
      

vainly we offer each ample oblation
vainly with gifts would his favour secure
richer by far is the heart’s adoration
dearer to god are the prayers of the poor
    
    
    
    


brightest and best of the sons of the morning

there is a gate that stands ajar
and through its portals gleaming
a radiance from the cross afar
the saviour’s love revealing
   
    
   
  
    

o depth of mercy can it be
that gate was left ajar for me
for me for me for me for me
was left ajar for me

   
   
   
  

that gate ajar stands free for all
who seek through it salvation
the rich and poor the great and small
of every tribe and nation
    
    
   
  

o depth of mercy can it be
that gate was left ajar for me
for me for me for me for me
was left ajar for me

   
   
   
  
press onward then though foes may
frown
while mercy’s gate is open
accept the cross and win the crown
love’s everlasting token
     
  
    
  

o depth of mercy can it be
that gate was left ajar for me
for me for me for me for me
was left ajar for me

   
   
   
  

beyond the river’s brink we’ll lay
the cross that here is given
and bear the crown of life away
and love him more in heaven
    
    
  
  


o depth of mercy can it be
that gate was left ajar for me
for me for me for me for me
was left ajar for me

grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt

there where the blood of the lamb
was spilled

jesus i am resting resting
in the joy of what thou art
i am finding out the greatness
of thy loving heart

thou hast bid me gaze upon thee
and thy beauty fills my soul
for by thy transforming power
thou hast made me whole
jesus i am resting resting

o how great thy loving-kindness
vaster broader than the sea
o how marvellous thy goodness
lavished all on me

yes i rest in thee beloved
know what wealth of grace is thine
know thy certainty of promise
and have made it mine

simply trusting thee lord jesus
i behold thee as thou art
and thy love so pure so changeless
satisfies my heart

satisfies its deepest longings
meets supplies its every need
compasseth me round with blessings
thine is love indeed


ever lift thy face upon me
as i work and wait for thee
resting ’neath thy smile lord jesus
earth’s dark shadows flee

brightness of my father’s glory
sunshine of my father’s face
keep me ever trusting resting
fill me with thy grace


jesus i my cross have taken
all to leave and follow thee
destitute despised forsaken
thou from hence my all shalt be
     
     
   
   
    

perish every fond ambition
all i’ve sought and hoped and known
yet how rich is my condition
god and heav’n are still my own
   
   
   
     

let the world despise and leave me
they have left my saviour too
human hearts and looks deceive me
thou art not like man untrue
    
    
   
    

and while thou shalt smile upon me
god of wisdom love and might
foes may hate and friends may shun me
show thy face and all is bright
   
     
   
    

man may trouble and distress me
’twill but drive me to thy breast
life with trials hard may press me
heaven will bring me sweeter rest
   
    
  
  

oh ’tis not in grief to harm me
while thy love is left to me
oh ’twere not in joy to charm me
were that joy unmixed with thee
   
    
   
    

hasten on from grace to glory
armed by faith and winged by prayer
heav’n’s eternal days before me
god’s own hand shall guide me there
  
  
  
   


soon shall close my earthly mission
swift shall pass my pilgrim days
hope shall change to glad fruition
faith to sight and prayer to praise

give thanks with a grateful heart

jesus shall reign wherev’r the sun
does its successive journeys run
his kingdom spread from shore to shore
’til moons shall wax and wane no more
   
   
   
      
    

behold the islands with their kings
and europe her best tribute brings
from north to south the princes meet
to pay their homage at his feet
    
    
   
     

to him shall endless prayer be made
and endless praises crown his head
his name like sweet perfume shall rise
with every morning sacrifice
   
   
    
    

people and realms of every tongue
dwell on his love with sweetest song
and infant voices shall proclaim
their early blessings on his name
    
  
  
  

where he displays his healing power
death and the curse are known no more
in him the tribes of adam boast
more blessings than their father lost
   
   
    
   

blessings abound where’er he reigns
the prisoner leaps to loose his chains
the weary find eternal rest
and all the sons of want are blest
 
   
   
   


let every creature rise and bring
his grateful honours to our king
angels descend with songs again
and earth repeat the loud “amen”

’neath the stars of the night
walked the saviour of light
in the garden of dew-ladened breeze
 
 
   
     

where no light could be found
jesus knelt on the ground
there he prayed ’neath the old
olive trees
   
  
    

’neath the old olive trees
’neath the old olive trees
went the saviour alone on his knees

  
  
   

“not my will thine be done”
cried the father’s own son
as he knelt ’neath the old olive trees
  
  
    

all the sins of the world
on the saviour was hurled
as he knelt in the garden alone
  
   
    

hear his soul-burdened plea
“let this cup pass from me
even so not my will thine be done”
  
  
     

’neath the old olive trees
’neath the old olive trees
went the saviour alone on his knees

  
  
   

“not my will thine be done”
cried the father’s own son
as he knelt ’neath the old olive trees
  
  
    

may my song ever be
of the love proffered me
by my lord all alone on his knees
   
   
    

praise his wonderful name
he who bore all my blame
as he knelt ’neath the old olive trees
    
    
    

’neath the old olive trees
’neath the old olive trees
went the saviour alone on his knees

  
  
   


“not my will thine be done”
cried the father’s own son
as he knelt ’neath the old olive trees
  
  
    


when jesus i knew not i did not know life
i spent all my days in contention and strife
then i heard a voice which all trouble surmounts
“he loves you he loves you”
how sweetly it sounds
    
      
     
      
       

in sin i was dead
but now i am saved
“he loves you he loves you”
how sweetly it sounds

and wrongs
and nowhere my spirit finds solace and songs

how sweetly it sounds
     
     
      
       

in sin i was dead
but now i am saved
“he loves you he loves you”

how deep the father’s love for us
how vast beyond all measure
that he should give his only son
to make a wretch his treasure

how great the pain of searing loss
the father turns his face away
as wounds which mar the chosen one
bring many sons to glory
how deep the father’s love

behold the man upon a cross
my sin upon his shoulders
ashamed i hear my mocking voice
call out among the scoffers

it was my sin that held him there
until it was accomplished
his dying breath has brought me life
i know that it is finished


i will not boast in anything
no gifts no pow’r no wisdom
but i will boast in jesus christ
his death and resurrection

why should i gain from his reward
i cannot give an answer
but this i know with all my heart
his wounds have paid my ransom


be not dismayed whate’er betide
god will take care of you
beneath his wings of love abide
god will take care of you

when dangers fierce your path assail

god will take care of you
thro’ every day o’er all the way
he will take care of you

to the rock that is higher than i

    
    
    
   

o sometimes how long seems the day
and sometimes how weary my feet
but toiling in life’s dusty way
the rock’s blessed shadow how sweet
   
    
    
  

o then to the rock let me fly
to the rock that is higher than i
o then to the rock let me fly
to the rock that is higher than i

    
    
    
   

o near to the rock let me keep
if blessings or sorrows prevail
or climbing the mountain way steep
or walking the shadowy vale
    
    
    
    


o then to the rock let me fly
to the rock that is higher than i
o then to the rock let me fly
to the rock that is higher than i

though thy foes be many
though thy strength be small
look away to jesus

look away to jesus
when the skies are fair
calm seas have their dangers
mariner beware
  
   
   
  

earthly joys are fleeting
going as they came
look away to jesus

look away to jesus
’mid the toil and heat
soon will come the resting
at the master’s feet
  
   
   
   

for the guests are bidden
and the feast is spread
look away to jesus
in his footsteps tread
  
 
  
    

when amid the music
of the endless feast
saints will sing his praises

then amid the glories
of the crystal sea
look away to jesus
through eternity
    
 
  
  

i am saved from sin
i have peace within
and i walk with jesus day by day
o his hand so strong
holds me all day long
and with him i will not go astray
   
   
    
   
    
    
-     

he will hold me with his mighty hand
he will hold me with his mighty hand
in temptation he will help me stand
for he will hold me with his mighty hand

   
    
   
    
many passed me by
heeding not my cry
but the saviour heard and rescued me
i was lost and blind
jesus was so kind
lo he touched my eyes and now i see
  
  
    
   
  
    

he will hold me with his mighty hand
he will hold me with his mighty hand
in temptation he will help me stand
for he will hold me with his mighty hand

   
    
   
    
there’s a promise sure
and it shall endure
“lo i will be with thee all the way”
and though foes assail
i shall still prevail
for i know he helps me watch and pray
   
    
    
  
    
    


he will hold me with his mighty hand
he will hold me with his mighty hand
in temptation he will help me stand
for he will hold me with his mighty hand

jesus name above all names
beautiful saviour glorious lord
emmanuel god is with us
blessed redeemer living word
-   ― ’

i’ve seen the lightning flashing
i’ve heard the thunder roll
i’ve felt sin’s breakers dashing
which almost conquered my soul
  
  
  
   
    

i’ve heard the voice of my saviour
bidding me still to fight on
he promised never to leave me
never to leave me alone
   
  
   
    

no never alone
no never alone
he promised never to leave me
he’ll claim me for his own

   
   
   
   

no never alone
no never alone
he promised never to leave me
never to leave me alone
   
   
   
   

the world’s fierce winds are blowing
temptation sharp and keen
i have a peace in knowing
my saviour stands between
   
  
  
   

he stands to shield me from danger
when my friends are all gone
he promised never to leave me
never to leave me alone
  
   
  
    

no never alone
no never alone
he promised never to leave me
he’ll claim me for his own

   
   
   
   

no never alone
no never alone
he promised never to leave me
never to leave me alone
   
   
   
   

when in affliction’s valley
i tread the road of care
my saviour helps me carry
the cross so heavy to bear
    
   
    
  

though all around me is darkness
earthly joys all flown
my saviour whispers his promise
never to leave me alone
   
   
   
    

no never alone
no never alone
he promised never to leave me
he’ll claim me for his own

   
   
   
   

no never alone
no never alone
he promised never to leave me
never to leave me alone
   
   
   
   

he died on calvary’s mountain
for me they piercd his side
for me he opened that fountain
the crimson cleansing tide
   
   
  
   

for me he waiteth in glory
seated upon his throne
he promised never to leave me
never to leave me alone
   
  
    
    

no never alone
no never alone
he promised never to leave me
he’ll claim me for his own

   
   
   
   


no never alone
no never alone
he promised never to leave me
never to leave me alone

though exiled from home yet still may i sing
all glory to god i’m a child of the king
      
      
      
    
 


i’m a child of the king
a child of the king
with jesus my saviour

what can take a dying man
and raise him up to life again
what can heal a wounded soul
what can make us white as snow

what can fill the emptiness
what can mend our brokenness
brokenness
  what can take a dying man



mighty awesome wonderful
is the holy cross
where the lamb laid down his life
to lift us from the fall
mighty is the power of the cross

what restores our faith in god
what reveals the father’s love
what can lead the wayward home
what can melt a heart of stone

what can free the guilty ones
what can save and overcome
overcome



mighty awesome wonderful
is the holy cross
where the lamb laid down his life
to lift us from the fall
mighty is the power of the cross


it’s a miracle to me
it’s a miracle to me
and it’s still a mystery
and it’s still a mystery

it’s a miracle to me
the power of god
for those who believe




mighty awesome wonderful
is the holy cross
where the lamb laid down his life
to lift us from the fall
mighty is the power of the cross


o safe to the rock
that is higher than i
my soul in its conflicts
and sorrows would fly
   
   
   
   
  

so sinful so weary
thine thine would i be
thou blest “rock of ages”
i’m hiding in thee
  
   
    
   

hiding in thee
hiding in thee
thou blest “rock of ages”
i’m hiding in thee

  
  
    
   

in the calm of the noontide
in sorrow’s lone hour
in times when temptation
casts o’er me its power
  
  
  
   

in the tempests of life
on its wide heaving sea
thou blest “rock of ages”
i’m hiding in thee
     
  
    
   

hiding in thee
hiding in thee
thou blest “rock of ages”
i’m hiding in thee

  
  
    
   

how oft in the conflict
when pressed by the foe
i have fled to my refuge
and breathed out my woe
   
  
   
    

how often when trials
like sea billows roll
have i hidden in thee
o thou rock of my soul
  
  
    
    


hiding in thee
hiding in thee
thou blest “rock of ages”
i’m hiding in thee

may our streets be filled with joy
may injustice bow to jesus
as the people turn to pray


from the mountain to the valley
hear our praises rise to you
from the heavens to the nations

may a light shine in the darkness
as we walk before the cross
may your glory fill the whole earth
as the water o’er the seas


from the mountain to the valley
hear our praises rise to you
from the heavens to the nations
hear our singing fill the air

hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah

precious moments we share
hearts rejoicing as we
congregate in the name of our lord
   
 
  
   

jesus promised that he
present with us would be
let our hearts beat with his in accord
  
   
    

oh how pleasant it is
in his presence to meet
shutting out the world’s tumult and din
   
   
   

how rewarding it is
just to sit at his feet
and receive untold blessings from him
  
 
  

travel-weary we come
to this haven of rest
to relax where god’s waters still flow
  
 
   

then renewed and restored
by his spirit refreshed
on our way with rejoicing we’ll go
  
  
   

in a fellowship blessed
our hearts have been bound
and by manna from heaven been fed
   
  
   

in god’s wonderful book
daily bread we have found
and new strength for the pathway ahead
  
  
    

in a close-knit communion
with christ as our head
and endued with god’s power from high
 
 
    


on the pathway of life
we by him will be led
knowing god all our needs will supply

at the crucified one

oh why was he there
as the bearer of sin
if on jesus thy guilt was not laid
  
   
   

oh why from his side
flowed the sin-cleansing blood
if his dying thy debt has not paid
  
   
    

look look look and live
there is life for a look
at the crucified one
there is life at this moment for thee

of repentance or prayers
but the blood that atones for the soul
 
  
   

on him then who shed it
thou mayest at once
thy weight of iniquities roll
   
  
     

look look look and live
there is life for a look
at the crucified one
there is life at this moment for thee

   
   
  
      

then doubt not thy welcome
since god has declared
there remaineth no more to be done
  
  
     

that once in the end
of the world he appeared
and completed the work he begun
   
     
     

look look look and live
there is life for a look
at the crucified one
there is life at this moment for thee

from jesus at once
the life everlasting he gives
    
 
   

and know with assurance

since jesus thy righteousness lives

there is life for a look
at the crucified one
there is life at this moment for thee

and commune with him often in prayer
from your heart every fear he will banish
and your soul he will lift from despair

on the cross for your sins he did pay
everlasting salvation he gave you
and he said “i am with you always”

don’t complain at the load you must bear
and at times when hard trials befall you
rest assured you are under his care
    
     
    
    

over life’s winds and waves he’s the master
to protect us he ever is near
he will save from the brink of disaster
and our craft into port he will steer
     
    
      
    
    
    
      
      
    
    
    
     

we hard trials are still undergoing
but soon life’s final battle will come
we will finish our course fully knowing
that we’re off to our heavenly home

there we’ll have peace and quietfor never
a disturbance or storm will be there
christ our saviour will reign there forever
and his glory and splendour we’ll share
   
     
    
    


precious soul cease from sadness and sorrow

and we know nottoday or tomorrow

o sacred head now wounded
with grief and shame weighed down
now scornfully surrounded
with thorns thine only crown
  
  
   
 
   

how pale thou art with anguish
with sore abuse and scorn
how does that visage languish
which once was bright as morn
    
  
    
   

what thou my lord hast suffered
was all for sinners’ gain
mine mine was the transgression
but thine the deadly pain
   
  
  
 

lo here i fall my saviour
’tis i deserve thy place
look on me with thy favour
vouchsafe to me thy grace
   
 
  
  

my burden in thy passion
lord thou hast borne for me
for it was my transgression
which brought this woe on thee
   
    
  
  

i cast me down before thee
wrath were my rightful lot
have mercy i implore thee
redeemer spurn me not
  
   
  
   

what language shall i borrow
to thank thee dearest friend
for this thy dying sorrow
thy pity without end

outlive my love to thee

thy spirit oft hath led me
to heavenly joys above
     
  
  
 


now thank we all our god
with heart and hands and voices
who wondrous things hath done
in whom this world rejoices
    
  
   
  
     

who from our mothers’ arms
hath blessed us on our way
with countless gifts of love
and still is ours today
   
   
  
 

o may this bounteous god
through all our life be near us
with ever joyful hearts
and blessed peace to cheer us

i must needs go home by the way of
the cross
there’s no other way but this
i shall ne’er get sight of the gates of light
if the way of the cross i miss
   
     
  
   
     
    

the way of the cross leads home
the way of the cross leads home
it is sweet to know as i onward go
the way of the cross leads home

   
   
     
   
i must needs go on in the blood-
sprinkled way
the path that the saviour trod
if i ever climb to the heights sublime
where the soul is at home with god
     
   
    

   

the way of the cross leads home
the way of the cross leads home
it is sweet to know as i onward go
the way of the cross leads home

   
   
     
   
then i bid farewell to the way of the world
to walk in it never more
for my lord says “come” and i seek
my home
where he waits at the open door
    
 
   
     
     


the way of the cross leads home
the way of the cross leads home
it is sweet to know as i onward go
the way of the cross leads home

i’m pressing on the upward way
new heights i’m gaining every day
still praying as i’m onward bound
“lord plant my feet on higher ground”
 
   
    
    
    

lord lift me up and let me stand
by faith on heaven’s tableland
a higher plain than i have found
lord plant my feet on higher ground

   
     
    
   
my heart has no desire to stay
where doubts arise and fears dismay
though some may dwell where these
abound
my prayer my aim is higher ground
    
    
     
    

lord lift me up and let me stand
by faith on heaven’s tableland
a higher plain than i have found
lord plant my feet on higher ground

   
     
    
   

i want to live above the world
though satan’s darts at me are hurled
for faith has caught the joyful sound
the song of saints on higher ground
    
   
    
    

lord lift me up and let me stand
by faith on heaven’s tableland
a higher plain than i have found
lord plant my feet on higher ground

   
     
    
   

i want to scale the utmost height
and catch a gleam of glory bright
but still i’ll pray ’til heaven i’ve found
“lord lead me on to higher ground”
   
  
   
   


lord lift me up and let me stand
by faith on heaven’s tableland
a higher plain than i have found

filled with messages for thee

at thy feet its treasure store
take myself and i will be
ever only all for thee

blessd be the fountain of blood
to a world of sinners revealed
blessd be the dear son of god
only by his stripes we are healed
   
    
   
   
   

tho’ i’ve wandered far from his fold
bringing to my heart pain and woe
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow
    
    
  
    

whiter than the snow
whiter than the snow
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow

and the cross his body o’ercame
grievous were the sorrows he bore
but he suffered thus not in vain
   
     
   
    

may i to that fountain be led
made to cleanse my sins here below
wash me in the blood that he shed
and i shall be whiter than snow

whiter than the snow
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow

   
  
    

father i have wandered from thee
often has my heart gone astray
crimson do my sins seem to me
water cannot wash them away
   
    
    
     

jesus to the fountain of thine
leaning on thy promise i go
cleanse me by thy washing divine
and i shall be whiter than snow
     
    
  
    


whiter than the snow
whiter than the snow
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow

o church arise and put your armour on
hear the call of christ our captain
for now the weak can say that they
are strong
in the strength that god has given

with shield of faith and belt of truth
we’ll stand against the devil’s lies
an army bold whose battle-cry is love
reaching out to those in darkness
  o church arise
our call to war to love the captive soul
but to rage against the captor
and with the sword that makes
the wounded whole
we will fight with faith and valour

when faced with trials on ev’ry side
we know the outcome is secure
and christ will have the prize
for which he died
an inheritance of nations
come see the cross where love and
mercy meet
as the son of god is stricken
then see his foes lie crushed beneath
his feet
for the conqueror has risen

and as the stone is rolled away
and christ emerges from the grave
this vict’ry march continues till the day
ev’ry eye and heart shall see him

so spirit come put strength in
ev’ry stride
give grace for ev’ry hurdle
that we may run with faith to win the prize
of a servant good and faithful

as saints of old still line the way
retelling triumphs of his grace
we hear their calls and hunger for the day
when with christ we stand in glory

in this passion of knowing
this endless love
i have in you


for the depths of grace
the forgiveness found
to be called
a child of god

just makes me say
how much i love you
oh my saviour
my lord and friend


jesus all for jesus
all i am and have
and ever hope to be


all of my ambitions hopes and plans
i surrender these
into your hands

jesus all for jesus



for it’s only in
your will that i am free
for it’s only in
your will that i am free

jesus all for jesus
all i am and have
and ever hope to be


my hope is built on nothing less
than jesus’ blood and righteousness
i dare not trust the sweetest frame
but wholly lean on jesus’ name
   
   
   
   
   

on christ the solid rock i stand
all other ground is sinking sand
all other ground is sinking sand

    
    
    

when darkness seems to hide his face
i rest on his unchanging grace
in every high and stormy gale
my anchor holds within the veil
    
  
    
   

on christ the solid rock i stand
all other ground is sinking sand
all other ground is sinking sand

    
    
    

his oath his covenant his blood
support me in the whelming flood
when all around my soul gives way
he then is all my hope and stay
   
    
   
    

on christ the solid rock i stand
all other ground is sinking sand
all other ground is sinking sand

    
    
    

when he shall come with trumpet sound
o may i then in him be found
dressed in his righteousness alone
faultless to stand before the throne
     
    
   
     


on christ the solid rock i stand
all other ground is sinking sand
all other ground is sinking sand

    
    
    


have you any room for jesus
he who bore your load of sin
as he knocks and asks admission
sinners will you let him in
   
   
   
   
    

room for jesus king of glory
hasten now his word obey
swing the heart’s door widely open
bid him enter while you may

   
   
   
   

room for pleasure room for business
but for christ the crucified
not a place that he can enter
in the heart for which he died

hasten now his word obey
swing the heart’s door widely open
bid him enter while you may

soon thy heart left cold and silent
and thy saviour’s pleading cease
  
    
  
    


room for jesus king of glory
hasten now his word obey
swing the heart’s door widely open
bid him enter while you may

   
   
   
   

how tedious and tasteless the hours
when jesus no longer i see
sweet prospects sweet birds
and sweet flowers
have all lost have all lost have all lost
have all lost their sweetness to me
    
    
    
   
     
   

the mid-summer sun shines so dim
the fields strive in vain to look bright
but when i am happy with him
december december december
december is as pleasant as may
   
     
   
     
     

his name yields the richest perfume
and sweeter than music his voice
his presence disperses my gloom
and makes all and makes all and makes all
and makes all within me rejoice
    
      
     
        
     


i should were he always thus nigh
have nothing to wish or to fear
no mortal so happy as i
my summer my summer my summer
my summer would last all the year

full of pity love and pow’r

in the arms of my dear saviour

once in royal david’s city
stood a lowly cattle shed
where a mother laid her baby
in a manger for his bed
mary was that mother mild
jesus christ her little child
once in royal david’s city


he came down to earth from heaven
who is god and lord of all
and his shelter was a stable
and his cradle was a stall
with the poor and meek and lowly
lived on earth our saviour holy


and through all his wondrous childhood
day by day like us he grew
he was little weak and helpless
tears and smiles like us he knew
and he feeleth for our sadness
and he shareth in our gladness


still among the poor and lowly
hope in christ is brought to birth
with the promise of salvation
for the nations of the earth
still in him our life is found
and our hope of heav’n is crowned


and our eyes at last shall see him
through his own redeeming love
for that child so dear and gentle
is our lord in heav’n above
and he leads his children on
to the place where he is gone



not in that poor lowly stable
with the oxen standing by
we shall see him but in heaven
set at god’s right hand on high
when like stars his children crowned
all in white shall wait around


true-hearted whole-hearted faithful and loyal
king of our lives by thy grace we will be
under the standard exalted and royal
strong in thy strength we will battle for thee
 
   
    
    
   

peal out the watchword silence it never
song of our spirits rejoicing and free
peal out the watchword loyal forever
king of our lives by thy grace we will be

   
    
     
     

true-hearted whole-hearted fullest allegiance
yielding henceforth to our glorious king
valiant endeavour and loving obedience
freely and joyously now would we bring
   
    
    
     

peal out the watchword silence it never
song of our spirits rejoicing and free
peal out the watchword loyal forever
king of our lives by thy grace we will be

   
    
     
     

true-hearted whole-hearted saviour
all-glorious
take thy great power and reign there alone
over our wills and affections victorious
freely surrendered and wholly thine own
   
    
    
    


peal out the watchword silence it never
song of our spirits rejoicing and free
peal out the watchword loyal forever
king of our lives by thy grace we will be

   
    
     
     


my faith looks up to thee
thou lamb of calvary
saviour divine
   
   
  
 

now hear me while i pray
take all my guilt away
oh let me from this day
be wholly thine
  
 
   
  

may thy rich grace impart
strength to my fainting heart
my zeal inspire
  
    
   

as thou hast died for me
oh may my love to thee
pure warm and changeless be
a living fire
    
   
   
 

while life’s dark maze i tread
and griefs around me spread
be thou my guide
   
   
 

bid darkness turn to day
wipe sorrow’s tears away
nor let me ever stray
from thee aside
   
 
   
  

when ends life’s transient dream
when death’s cold sullen stream
shall o’er me roll
   
  
 


blest saviour then in love
fear and distrust remove
oh bear me safe above
a ransomed soul
  
    
    
  


jesus lover of my soul
all consuming fire is in your gaze
jesus i want you to know
i will follow you all my days

for no one else in history is like you
and history itself belongs to you
alpha and omega you have loved me
and i will share eternity with you
jesus lover of my soul



it’s all about you jesus
and all this is for you
for your glory and your fame
it’s not about me
as if you should do things my way
you alone are god
and i surrender to your ways


for the beauty of the earth
for the glory of the skies
for the love which from our birth
over and around us lies

there is none like you
no one else can touch my heart
like you do
i could search for all eternity long
and find there is none like you
there is none like you



your mercy flows like a river wide
and healing comes from your hands
suffering children are safe
in your arms
there is none like you




there is none like you
no one else can touch my heart
like you do
i could search for all eternity long
and find there is none like you
repeat


now the day is over
night is drawing nigh
shadows of the evening
steal across the sky
 
  
  
 
  

jesus give the weary
calm and sweet repose
with thy tenderest blessing
may mine eyelids close
 
  
  
 

grant to little children
visions bright of thee
guard the sailors tossing
on the deep blue sea
 
 
  
  

through the long night watches
may thine angels spread
their white wings above me
watching round my bed
 
    
 
  


when the morning wakens
then may i arise
pure and fresh and sinless
in thy holy eyes
   
  
   
  




fear not for i am with you
fear not for i am with you
fear not for i am with you
says the lord
fear not

i have redeemed you
i’ve called you by name
child you are mine
when you walk through the waters
i’ll be there
and through the flame

you’ll not no way be burnt
you’ll not no way be drowned
for i am with you
fear not


’tis so sweet to trust in jesus
just to take him at his word
just to rest upon his promise

joy has dawned upon the world
promised from creation
god’s salvation now unfurled
hope for ev’ry nation

not with fanfares from above
not with scenes of glory
but a humble gift of love
jesus born of mary
  joy has dawned

sounds of wonder fill the sky
with the songs of angels
as the mighty prince of life
shelters in a stable

hands that set each star in place
shaped the earth in darkness
cling now to a mother’s breast
vulnerable and helpless

shepherds bow before the lamb
gazing at the glory
gifts of men from distant lands
prophesy the story

gold a king is born today
incense god is with us
myrrh his death will make a way
and by his blood he’ll win us


son of adam son of heav’n
given as a ransom
reconciling god and man
christ our mighty champion

what a saviour what a friend
what a glorious mystery
once a babe in bethlehem
now the lord of history


like a waterfall
is to one drop of rain
like a mountain tow’rs
above a single grain of sand

like the blazing sun
is to a candle flame
like a thousand years to one day
you are god and we are not
  like a waterfall
beyond sight beyond mind
beyond sense space and time
most beautiful mystery of all


you are god above
angels worship you
most beautiful mystery
three times holy god
god whose name is love
most beautiful mystery
you stride among the stars
you call them each by name
to you the galaxies
are only dust upon the scales

before the world was formed
not even day or night
and all the angels sang
with pure delight
you were there and we were not
beyond sight beyond mind
beyond sense space and time
most beautiful mystery of all


you are god above
angels worship you
most beautiful mystery
three times holy god
god whose name is love
most beautiful mystery


you are god my god
you are most beautiful mystery


you are god above
angels worship you
most beautiful mystery
three times holy god
god whose name is love
most beautiful mystery

o for a faith that will not shrink
tho’ pressed by ev’ry foe
that will not tremble on the brink
of any earthly woe
    
    
  
    
   

that will not murmur nor complain
beneath the chastening rod
but in the hour of grief or pain
will lean upon its god
     
  
  
   

a faith that shines more bright and clear
when tempests rage without
that when in danger knows no fear
in darkness feels no doubt
   
   
     
  


lord give us such a faith as this
and then whate’er may come
we’ll taste e’en here the hallowed bliss
of an eternal home

god is good all the time
through the darkest night
his light will shine
god is good god is good
god is good he’s so good
god is good he’s so good
all the time


it may not be on the mountain’s height
or over the stormy sea
it may not be at the battle’s front
my lord will have need of me
    
     
     
      
   
but if by a still small voice he calls
to paths i do not know
i’ll answer dear lord with my hand
in yours
i’ll go where you want me to go
    
   
    
    

i’ll go where you want me to go dear lord
o’er mountain or plain or sea
i’ll say what you want me to say dear lord
i’ll be what you want me to be

     
   
      
     

perhaps today there are loving words
which jesus would have me speak
there may be now in the paths of sin
some wand’rer whom i should seek
    
   
    
   

o saviour if you will be my guide
though dark and rugged the way
my voice shall echo the message sweet
i’ll say what you want me to say
    
    
      
     

i’ll go where you want me to go dear lord
o’er mountain or plain or sea
i’ll say what you want me to say dear lord
i’ll be what you want me to be

     
   
      
     

there’s surely somewhere a lowly place
in earth’s harvest fields so wide
where i may labour through life’s short day
for jesus the crucified
    
  
     
  

so trusting my all unto your care
i know you always love me
i’ll do your will with a heart sincere
i’ll be what you want me to be
   
   
     
     


i’ll go where you want me to go dear lord
o’er mountain or plain or sea
i’ll say what you want me to say dear lord
i’ll be what you want me to be

     
   
      
     


i will sing of my redeemer
and his wondrous love to me
on the cruel cross he suffered
from the curse to set me free
   
   
   
   
  

sing oh sing of my redeemer
with his blood he purchased me
on the cross he sealed my pardon
paid the debt and made me free

    
   
    
    

i will tell the wondrous story
how my lost estate to save
in his boundless love and mercy
he the ransom freely gave
  
    
    
   

sing oh sing of my redeemer
with his blood he purchased me
on the cross he sealed my pardon
paid the debt and made me free

    
   
    
    

i will praise my dear redeemer
his triumphant power i’ll tell
how the victory he giveth
over sin and death and hell
   
  
   
    

sing oh sing of my redeemer
with his blood he purchased me
on the cross he sealed my pardon
paid the debt and made me free

    
   
    
    

i will sing of my redeemer
and his heav’nly love to me
he from death to life hath brought me
son of god with him to be
   
  
    
    


sing oh sing of my redeemer
with his blood he purchased me
on the cross he sealed my pardon
paid the debt and made me free

    
   
    
    


brightly beams our father’s mercy
from his lighthouse evermore
but to us he gives the keeping
of the lights along the shore
-      
    
   ―
    
 

let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
for to us he gives the keeping
of the lights along the shore

    
   
   
   

dark the night of sin has settled
loud the angry billows roar
eager eyes are watching longing
for the lights along the shore
    
  
  
  

let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
eager eyes are watching longing
for the lights along the shore

    
   
   
   

trim your feeble lamp my brother
some poor sailor tempest tossed
trying now to make the harbour
in the darkness may be lost
    
  
    
’     


let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
trying now to make the harbour
some poor sailor may be lost

    
   
   
   


who is on the lord’s side
who will serve the king
who will be his helpers
other lives to bring
   
   
  
   ―
 

who will leave the world’s side
who will face the foe
who is on the lord’s side
who for him will go
  
 
   
  

by thy call of mercy
by thy grace divine
we are on the lord’s side
saviour we are thine
  
   
  
  

not for weight of glory
not for crown and palm
enter we the army
raise the warrior psalm
   
  
 
 

but for love that claimeth
lives for whom he died
he whom jesus nameth
must be on his side
    
   
 
 

by thy love constraining
by thy grace divine
we are on the lord’s side
saviour we are thine
 
   
  
  

jesus thou hast bought us
not with gold or gem
but with thine own life-blood
for thy diadem
  
   
 
  

with thy blessing filling
each who comes to thee
thou hast made us willing
thou hast made us free
 
   
  
 

by thy grand redemption
by thy grace divine
we are on the lord’s side
saviour we are thine
 
   
  
  

fierce may be the conflict
strong may be the foe
but the king’s own army
none can overthrow
   
  
  
  

’round his standard ranging
victory to secure
for his truth unchanging
makes the triumph sure
  
  
    
 


joyfully enlisting
by thy grace divine
we are on the lord’s side
saviour we are thine

one sat alone beside the highway begging
his eyes were blind the light he could not see
he clutched his rags and shivered in the
shadows
then jesus came and bade his darkness flee
 
    
       
     
      

when jesus comes the tempter’s power is
broken
when jesus comes the tears are wiped away
he takes the gloom and fills the life with glory
for all is changed when jesus comes to stay

      
    
    
      

from home and friends the evil spirits
drove him
among the tombs he dwelt in misery
he cut himself as demon powers possessed him
then jesus came and set the captive free
     
    
     
     

when jesus comes the tempter’s power is
broken
when jesus comes the tears are wiped away
he takes the gloom and fills the life with glory
for all is changed when jesus comes to stay

      
    
    
      

“unclean unclean” the leper cried in torment
the deaf the dumb in helplessness stood near
the fever raged disease had gripped its victim
then jesus came and cast out every fear 
    

     
      
     

when jesus comes the tempter’s power is
broken
when jesus comes the tears are wiped away
he takes the gloom and fills the life with glory
for all is changed when jesus comes to stay

      
    
    
      

their hearts were sad as in the tomb they
laid him
for death had come and taken him away
their night was dark and bitter tears were falling
then jesus came and night was turned to day
       

       
    
      

when jesus comes the tempter’s power is
broken
when jesus comes the tears are wiped away
he takes the gloom and fills the life with glory
for all is changed when jesus comes to stay

      
    
    
      

so men today have found the saviour able
they could not conquer passion lust and sin
their broken hearts had left them sad and
lonely
then jesus came and dwelt himself within 
      
      
      
      


when jesus comes the tempter’s power is
broken
when jesus comes the tears are wiped away
he takes the gloom and fills the life with glory
for all is changed when jesus comes to stay

      
    
    
      


to god be the glory
to god be the glory
to god be the glory
for the things he has done
    
 
 
 
    


by his blood he has saved me
by his power he has raised me
to god be the glory
for the things he has done
   
   
 
    



god’s not dead no he is alive
god’s not dead no he is alive
god’s not dead no he is alive

praise him with my mouth
praise him with my feet
praise him with my hands
love him in my life
jesus is alive in me
god’s not dead


wildly life’s billows ’round my soul are beating
fierce is the tempest dangerous is the sea
driven by terror i come to thee pleading
“father in heaven o hear thou my plea”
 
   
   
     
     

in thy great mercy help me i implore thee
long have i struggled but to no avail
my strength is spenti cast myself before thee
“help me my father without thee i fall”
     
      
      
    


into the calmness of thy harbour guide me
instil a peace and trust within my soul
amid life’s tempest stay thou o’er beside me
bring me at last to my heavenly goal

praising him forevermore

that he has trod
up to where they gather on the hills of god

more love to thee

then shall my latest breath
whisper thy praise
this be the parting cry
my heart shall raise
   
  
   
  


this still my prayer shall be
more love o christ to thee
more love to thee
more love to thee
     
   
 
  


he lives he lives
he triumphed over death
he lives he lives
the lord revealed his strength
   

   
   
   
   

he lives he lives
enthroned above all earthly strife
he leads us to eternal life
   
 
     

the wicked hands of sinners
had nailed him to the tree
our guilt and our transgressions
had caused his agony
  
  
  
  

the sweat like blood was flowing
from his disfigured brow
his task was done
oh praise him now
  
    
    

he lives he lives
he triumphed over death
he lives he lives
the lord revealed his strength

   
   
   
   

he lives he lives
enthroned above all earthly strife
he leads us to eternal life
   
 
     

his body then was taken
by joseph from the cross
in his own tomb he laid it
not counting it a loss
  
    
   
   

but suddenly the sun shone
and darkness took its flight
the lord had said
“let there be light”
   
   
    

he lives he lives
he triumphed over death
he lives he lives
the lord revealed his strength

   
   
   
   

he lives he lives
enthroned above all earthly strife
he leads us to eternal life
   
 
     

at dawn there came with mary
some women to the tomb
an angel stood beside them
and scattered all their gloom
   
   
  
   

“go quickly tell the others
that he is risen from the dead”
and death forever
lost its dread
  
   
   

he lives he lives
he triumphed over death
he lives he lives
the lord revealed his strength

   
   
   
   

he lives he lives
enthroned above all earthly strife
he leads us to eternal life
   
 
     

as mary stands bewildered
still grieving in her heart
she sees her risen saviour
and can’t contain her start
   
  
   
   

she shouts in exultation
“my master and my lord”
and quickly runs
to spread the word
   
  
    

he lives he lives
he triumphed over death
he lives he lives
the lord revealed his strength

   
   
   
   


he lives he lives
enthroned above all earthly strife
he leads us to eternal life
   
 
     


sinners jesus will receive
sound this word of grace to all
who the heavenly pathway leave
all who linger all who fall
  
   
    
    
   

sing it o’er and over again
christ receiveth sinful men

purged from every spot and stain
heaven with him i enter in
  
  
   
   


sing it o’er and over again
christ receiveth sinful men
make the message clear and plain
christ receiveth sinful men

with harp and with organ and voice
the loud hallelujahs prolong
   
  
    
   


rejoice rejoice
be glad in the lord and rejoice
rejoice rejoice
be glad in the lord and rejoice

 
   
 
   

who is there like you o god
you created us in your likeness
who is there like you o god
it’s an honour lord
to stand and worship you


and we lift our hands to the great i am
who was and who is and is to come
we lift our hands to the great i am
who can compare with you
  who is there like you

who is there like you o god
you created us for your pleasure
who is there like you o god
you’ve appointed us
to be your very own


and we lift our hands to the great i am
who was and who is and is to come
we lift our hands to the great i am
who can compare with you


you know the way though it is hidden from me
since you are there my heart is filled with peace
why should i fear when you go on before me
both night and day you set my heart at ease
  
       
    
     
      

you know the way the time of my translation
was planned before i even lived one day
my heart is filled with wonder and elation
for you have loved and led me all the way
      
      
     
    

lord you know all the winds that blow and
frighten
the storms of life your orders still obey
and even though my burdens may not lighten
still i’m at peace because you know the way
     
    
     
      


there were ninety and nine that safely lay
in the shelter of the fold
but one was out on the hills away
far off from the gates of gold
  
   
     
     
     

away on the mountains wild and bare
away from the tender shepherd’s care
away from the tender shepherd’s care
    
     
     
lord thou hast here thy ninety and nine
are they not enough for thee
but the shepherd made answer
“this of mine
has wandered away from me
   
   
      
     

and although the road be rough and steep
i go to the desert to find my sheep
i go to the desert to find my sheep”
       
    
    
but none of the ransomed ever knew
how deep were the waters crossed
nor how dark was the night
that the lord passed thro’
ere he found his sheep that was lost
     
     
       
    

out in the desert he heard its cry
sick and helpless and ready to die
sick and helpless and ready to die
    
      
      
lord whence are those blood drops
all the way
that mark out the mountain’s track
they were shed for one who had gone
astray
ere the shepherd could bring him back

    
    
     
    

lord whence are thy hands so rent
and torn
they’re pierced tonight by many a thorn
they’re pierced tonight by many a thorn
     
     
     
but all thro’ the mountains thunder riv’n
and up from the rocky steep
there arose a glad cry to the gate
of heav’n
“rejoice i have found my sheep”
    
     
      
   


and the angels echoed around the throne
“rejoice for the lord brings back his own
rejoice for the lord brings back his own”
     
   
   


jesus my lord to thee i cry
unless thou help me i must die
oh bring thy free salvation nigh
and take me as i am
   
   
      
    
   

and take me as i am
and take me as i am
my only pleachrist died for me
oh take me as i am

   
   
    
   

helpless i am and full of guilt
but yet for me thy blood was spilt
and thou canst make me what thou wilt
and take me as i am
    
    
   
   

and take me as i am
and take me as i am
my only pleachrist died for me
oh take me as i am

   
   
    
   

no preparation can i make
my best resolves i only break
yet save me for thine own name’s sake
and take me as i am
   
    
     
   

and take me as i am
and take me as i am
my only pleachrist died for me
oh take me as i am

   
   
    
   

behold me saviour at thy feet
deal with me as thou seest meet
thy work begin thy work complete
and take me as i am
     
  
    
   


and take me as i am
and take me as i am
my only pleachrist died for me
oh take me as i am

   
   
    
   


i heard the voice of jesus say
“come unto me and rest
lay down thou weary one lay down
thy head upon my breast”
   
   
    
    
  

i came to jesus as i was
weary and worn and sad
i found in him a resting place
and he has made me glad
    
   
     
   

i heard the voice of jesus say
“behold i freely give
the living water thirsty one
stoop down and drink and live”
   
  
   
  

i came to jesus and i drank
of that life-giving stream
my thirst was quenched my soul revived
and now i live in him
     
  
     
   

i heard the voice of jesus say
“i am this dark world’s light
look unto me thy morn shall rise
and all thy day be bright”
   
     
    
   


i looked to jesus and i found
in him my star my sun
and in that light of life i’ll walk
till travelling days are done

jesus saviour pilot me
over life’s tempestuous sea
unknown waves before me roll
hiding rocks and treach’rous shoal
chart and compass come from thee
jesus saviour pilot me
    
    
  
   
   
   
    
as a mother stills her child
thou canst hush the ocean wild
boist’rous waves obey thy will
when thou say’st to them “be still”
wondrous sov’reign of the sea
jesus saviour pilot me
   
   
   
 
  
    

when at last i near the shore
and the fearful breakers roar
’twixt me and the peaceful rest
then while leaning on thy breast
may i hear thee say to me
“fear not i will pilot thee”
     
   
   
    
   
    


have your sins been washed in the flow
from the cross on dark calvary
and the one who died do you know
that from sin you might ransomed be
    
    
    
    
    

though like scarlet your sins may be
heavy though the weight of your woe
his blood can make you free from sin
it can make them whiter than snow

     
   
   
    

on the cross forsaken was he
from the cross his blood trickled down
that mankind from sin could be free
for the cross exchanged he his crown
  
   
    
   

though like scarlet your sins may be
heavy though the weight of your woe
his blood can make you free from sin
it can make them whiter than snow

     
   
   
    

jesus called and i did reply
“come to me” he saidi did go
what i was no longer am i
his blood made me whiter than snow
    
    
    
    

though like scarlet your sins may be
heavy though the weight of your woe
his blood can make you free from sin
it can make them whiter than snow

     
   
   
    

like the wayward lamb i had strayed
“pastures green” were silver and gold
on the cross atonement was made
jesus brought me back to the fold
    
   
    
     

though like scarlet your sins may be
heavy though the weight of your woe
his blood can make you free from sin
it can make them whiter than snow

     
   
   
    

contemplating i love to see
from the cross the life-giving flow
to us bringing grace full and free
by it making us white as snow
   
   
     
    


though like scarlet your sins may be
heavy though the weight of your woe
his blood can make you free from sin
it can make them whiter than snow

     
   
   
    


on a hill far away
stood an old rugged cross
the emblem of suffering and shame
and i love that old cross
where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain
    

      
    
       
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

   
    
    
    

oh that old rugged cross
so despised by the world
has a wondrous attraction for me
for the dear lamb of god left his glory above
to bear it to dark calvary
     

      
        
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

   
    
    
    
in that old rugged cross
stained with blood so divine
a wondrous beauty i see
for ’twas on that old cross
jesus suffered and died
to pardon and sanctify me
     
 
     
     
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

   
    
    
    

to the old rugged cross i will ever be true
it’s shame and reproach gladly bear
then he’ll call me some day
to my home far away
where his glory forever i’ll share
     

     
      
     


so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

my god my father while i stray
far from my home on life’s rough way
oh teach me from my heart to say
“thy will be done”
   
   
    
  
  

thy will be done
thy will be done
oh teach me from my heart to say
“thy will be done”
  
  
  
  

though thou hast called me to resign
what most i prized it ne’er was mine
i have but yielded what was thine
“thy will be done”
    
     
    
  

thy will be done
thy will be done
i have but yielded what was thine

thy will be done
thy will be done
my father still i strive to say
“thy will be done”

blend it with thine and take away
all that now makes it hard to say

thy will be done
thy will be done
all that now makes it hard to say
“thy will be done”
  
  
   
  

then when on earth i breathe no more
the prayer oft mixed with tears before
i’ll sing upon a happier shore
“thy will be done”
    
    
    
  


thy will be done

i’ll sing upon a happier shore

speak o lord as we come to you
to receive the food of your holy word
take your truth plant it deep in us
shape and fashion us in your likeness

that the light of christ might be seen today
in our acts of love and our deeds of faith
speak o lord and fulfil in us
all your purposes for your glory
  speak o lord
teach us lord full obedience
holy reverence true humility
test our thoughts and our attitudes
in the radiance of your purity

cause our faith to rise
cause our eyes to see
your majestic love and authority
words of pow’r that can never fail
let their truth prevail over unbelief

speak o lord and renew our minds
help us grasp the heights
of your plans for us
truths unchanged from the dawn of time
that will echo down through eternity

and by grace we’ll stand on your promises
and by faith we’ll walk as you walk with us
speak o lord till your church is built
and the earth is filled with your glory

when the oceans rise and thunders roar
i will soar with you above the storm
father you are king over the flood

know his power in quietness and trust


when the oceans rise and thunders roar
i will soar with you above the storm

jesus loves me jesus loves me
i am so glad that jesus loves me
jesus loves even me

ho all ye heavy laden come
here’s pardon comfort rest and home
ye wand’rers from a father’s face
return accept his proffered grace
   
     
    
    

ye tempted ones there’s refuge nigh
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”
ye tempted ones there’s refuge nigh
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”
     
  
     
  

but if you still his call refuse
and all his wondrous love abuse
soon will he sadly from you turn
your bitter prayer for pardon spurn
   
   
  
    


“too late too late” will be the cry
“jesus of nazareth has passed by”
“too late too late” will be the cry
“jesus of nazareth has passed by”

i cannot tell
how he whom angels worship
should stoop to love
the peoples of the earth
or why as shepherd
he should seek the wand’rer
with his mysterious
promise of new birth
i cannot tell

but this i know
that he was born of mary
when bethl’em’s manger
was his only home
and that he lived
at nazareth and laboured
and so the saviour
saviour of the world is come

i cannot tell
how silently he suffered
as with his peace
he graced this place of tears
or how his heart
upon the cross was broken
the crown of pain
to three and thirty years

but this i know
he heals the broken-hearted
and stays our sin
and calms our lurking fear
and lifts the burden
from the heavy laden
for yet the saviour
saviour of the world is here

i cannot tell
how he will win the nations
how he will claim
his earthly heritage
how satisfy the needs
and aspirations
of east and west
of sinner and of sage

but this i know
all flesh shall see his glory
and he shall reap
the harvest he has sown
and some glad day
his sun shall shine in splendour
when he the saviour
saviour of the world is known

i cannot tell
how all the lands shall worship
when at his bidding
ev’ry storm is stilled
or who can say
how great the jubilation
when ev’ry heart
with perfect love is filled


but this i know
the skies will thrill with rapture
and myriad myriad
human voices sing
and earth to heav’n
and heav’n to earth will answer
“at last the saviour
saviour of the world is king”


take me past the outer courts
and through the holy place
past the brazen altar
lord i want to see your face

pass me by the crowds of people
and the priests who sing their praise
i hunger and thirst for your righteousness
but it’s only found one place
  take me past the outer courts



so take me in to the holy of holies
take me in by the blood of the lamb
so take me in to the holy of holies
take the coal cleanse my lips
here i am



is it true today
that when people pray
cloudless skies will break
kings and queens will shake
yes it’s true and i believe it
i’m living for you

well it’s true today
that when people pray
we’ll see dead men rise
and the blind set free
yes it’s true and i believe it
i’m living for you

in this land
i’m going to be a speaker of truth
to all mankind

i’m going to stand
i’m going to run into your arms
into your arms again
into your arms into your arms again
well it’s true today
that when people stand
with the fire of god
and the truth in hand

we’ll see miracles
we’ll see angels sing
we’ll see broken hearts
making history
yes it’s true and i believe it
i’m living for you



i’m going to be a history maker
in this land
i’m going to be a speaker of truth
to all mankind

i’m going to stand
i’m going to run into your arms
into your arms again
into your arms into your arms again


when jesus i knew not i did not know life
i spent all my days in contention and strife
then i heard a voice which all trouble surmounts

i am a stranger here within a foreign land

ambassador to be of realms beyond the sea
i’m here on business for my king
   
       
      
     
  

this is the message that i bring
a message angels fain would sing
“oh be ye reconciled”
thus saith my lord and king
“oh be ye reconciled to god”

   
   
   
   
   
this is the king’s command that all men
everywhere
repent and turn away from sin’s seductive snare
that all who will obey with him shall reign for
aye
and that’s my business for my king

eternal life and joy throughout its vast domain
my sovereign bids me tell how mortals there
may dwell
and that’s my business for my king
      
      
      
  


this is the message that i bring

to a world of sinners revealed
blessd be the dear son of god
only by his stripes we are healed
    
    
   
    
  

tho’ i’ve wandered far from his fold
bringing to my heart pain and woe
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow
  
   
  
    

whiter than the snow
whiter than the snow
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow

   
  
    

thorny was the crown that he wore
and the cross his body o’ercame
grievous were the sorrows he bore
but he suffered thus not in vain
   
    
    
   

may i to that fountain be led
made to cleanse my sins here below
wash me in the blood that he shed
and i shall be whiter than snow
   
    
  
    

whiter than the snow
whiter than the snow
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow

   
  
    

father i have wandered from thee
often has my heart gone astray
crimson do my sins seem to me
water cannot wash them away
    
   
    
    

jesus to the fountain of thine
leaning on thy promise i go
cleanse me by thy washing divine
and i shall be whiter than snow

whiter than the snow
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow

and thus he bound me to him
   
   
   
  
   

and round my heart still closely twine
those ties which naught can sever
for i am his and he is mine
forever and forever
    
   
     
  

i’ve found a friend o such a friend
he bled he died to save me
and not alone the gift of life
but his own self he gave me
   
   
     
   

naught that i have mine own i call
i’ll hold it for the giver
my heart my strength my life my all
are his and his forever
     
   
    
  

i’ve found a friend o such a friend
all pow’r to him is given
to guard me on my onward course
and bring me safe to heaven
   
   
   
  

th’ eternal glories gleam afar
to nerve my faint endeavour
so now to watch to work to war
and then to rest forever
  
  
      
  

i’ve found a friend o such a friend
so kind and true and tender
so wise a counsellor and guide
so mighty a defender
   
   
    
 


from him who loves me now so well
what power my soul can sever
shall life or death shall earth or hell
no i am his forever

did you feel the mountains tremble
did you hear the oceans roar
when the people rose to sing of
jesus christ the risen one

did you feel the people tremble
did you hear the singers roar
when the lost began to sing of
jesus christ the saving one

  did you feel the mountains


and we can see that god
you’re moving
a mighty river through the nations
and young and old will turn to jesus

fling wide you heavenly gates
prepare the way of the risen lord


open up the doors and
let the music play
let the streets resound with singing
songs that bring your hope
songs that bring your joy
dancers who dance upon injustice



do you feel the darkness tremble
when all the saints join in one song
and all the streams flow as one river
to wash away our brokenness



and we can see that god
you’re moving
a time of jubilee is coming
when young and old will turn to jesus

fling wide you heavenly gates
prepare the way of the risen lord



open up the doors and
let the music play
let the streets resound with singing
songs that bring your hope
songs that bring your joy
dancers who dance upon injustice


up calvary’s mountain one dreadful morn
walked christ my saviour weary and worn
facing for sinners death on the cross
that he might save them from endless loss
  
   
     
    
     

blessd redeemer precious redeemer
seems now i see him on calvary’s tree
wounded and bleeding for sinners pleading
blind and unheedingdying for me

   
     
    
     

“father forgive them” thus did he pray
e’en while his lifeblood flowed fast away
praying for sinners while in such woe
no one but jesus ever loved so
     
     
    
     

blessd redeemer precious redeemer
seems now i see him on calvary’s tree
wounded and bleeding for sinners pleading

than the deepest of seas

his love it stretches
to the farthest horizon
and his love it reaches to me

in my life’s darkest hour

his love secures me
on the pathway to heaven
and his love is my strength and power

than the sweetest of honey
his love is better
than the choicest of wine

his love it satisfies
the deepest of hunger
and his love in jesus it’s mine


your love is higher
than the highest of mountains
your love goes deeper
than the deepest of seas

your love it stretches

and your love it reaches to me

there is a fountain filled with blood
drawn from emmanuel’s veins
and sinners plunged beneath that flood
lose all their guilty stains
   
   
  
    
   

the dying thief rejoiced to see
that fountain in his day
and there may i though vile as he
wash all my sins away
    
    
     
   

dear dying lamb thy precious blood
shall never lose its pow’r
till all the ransomed church of god
are saved to sin no more
   
   
    
  

e’er since by faith i saw the stream
thy flowing wounds supply
redeeming love has been my theme
and shall be till i die
   
   
   
  
when this poor lisping
stammering tongue
lies silent in the grave
then in a nobler sweeter song
i’ll sing thy power to save

the mountains are his
the stars are his handiwork too

our god is so great

and speak some boundless thing
the mighty works or mightier name
of our eternal king
    
   
 
  
  

tell of his wonderful faithfulness
and sound his power abroad
sing the sweet promise of his grace
the love and truth of god

for wretched dying men”
his hand has writ the sacred word
with an immortal pen

the voice that rolls the stars along
speaks all the promises

those gentle words shall raise my song
to notes almost divine
    
    
   
    


on calvary’s brow my saviour died
’twas there my lord was crucified
’twas on the cross he bled for me
and purchased there my pardon free
    
    
    
       
    

o calvary dark calvary
where jesus shed his blood for me
o calvary blest calvary
’twas there my saviour died for me

   
      
   
     

’mid rending rocks and darkening skies
my saviour bows his head and dies
the opening veil reveals the way
to life divine and endless day
     
   
    
     

o calvary dark calvary
where jesus shed his blood for me
o calvary blest calvary
’twas there my saviour died for me

   
      
   
     

o jesus lord how can it be
that thou shouldst give thy life for me
to bear the cross and agony
in that dread hour on calvary
   
     
     
     


o calvary dark calvary
where jesus shed his blood for me
o calvary blest calvary
’twas there my saviour died for me

   
      
   
     


were you there when they crucified my lord
were you there when they crucified my lord
oh sometimes it causes me to tremble
tremble tremble
were you there when they crucified my lord

were you there when they nailed him to the tree
were you there when they nailed him to the tree
oh sometimes it causes me to tremble
tremble tremble
were you there when they nailed him to the tree
  were you there

were you there when they laid him in the tomb
were you there when they laid him in the tomb
oh sometimes it causes me to tremble
tremble tremble
were you there when they laid him in the tomb

were you there when he rose up from the grave
were you there when he rose up from the grave
oh sometimes it causes me to tremble
tremble tremble
were you there when he rose up from the grave


jesus the very thought of thee
with sweetness fills my breast
but sweeter far thy face to see
and in thy presence rest
   
   
  
    
    

no voice can sing no heart can frame
nor can the mem’ry find
a sweeter sound than thy blest name
o saviour of mankind
   
  
    
   

o hope of every contrite heart
o joy of all the meek
to those who fall how kind thou art
how good to those who seek
  
    
   
    

but what to those who find ah this
nor tongue nor pen can show
the love of jesus what it is
none but his loved ones know
    
   
   
    

o jesus light of all below
thou fount of living fire
surpassing all the joys we know
and all we can desire
     
  
    
  


jesus our only joy be thou
as thou our prize wilt be
jesus be thou our glory now
and through eternity
   
  
   
   


the wonder of your cross
shall be our meditation
to gather in that shadow
as the sun went down

to weep with those who thought
that you were leaving
you were leaving jesus
the humble king
who never wore an earthly crown
  the wonder of your cross
to steal away at night
when they took down your body
with love and tears to leave you
in a borrowed grave

to go with mary to
that place they laid you
where they laid you jesus
and in the morning
find the stone was rolled away



the cross o the wonderful cross
what glory what victory i’ve found
i’ll come to the wonderful cross
and my whole life i lay down
were heaven’s praises silent
in those hours of darkness
your holy spirit brooding
’round that empty throne

until the declaration
“he is risen”
you are risen jesus
he is not dead
behold he lives for evermore




the cross o the wonderful cross
what glory what victory i’ve found
i’ll come to the wonderful cross
and my whole life i lay down


in the land of strangers
whither thou art gone
hear a far voice calling
“my son my son”
  
  
  
  
   

“welcome wand’rer welcome
welcome back to home

“must i go and empty handed”
thus my dear redeemer meet
not one day of service give him
lay no trophy at his feet
    
    
   
     
    

“must i go and empty handed”
must i meet my saviour so
not one soul with which to greet him
must i empty handed go

    
   
    
 

not at death i shrink or falter
for my saviour saves me now
but to meet him empty handed
thought of that now clouds my brow
   
    
    
    

“must i go and empty handed”
must i meet my saviour so
not one soul with which to greet him
must i empty handed go

    
   
    
 

o the years in sinning wasted
could i but recall them now
i would give them to my saviour
to his will i’d gladly bow
    
  
    
   

“must i go and empty handed”
must i meet my saviour so
not one soul with which to greet him
must i empty handed go

    
   
    
 

o ye saints arouse be earnest
up and work while yet ’tis day
ere the night of death o’ertake thee
strive for souls while still you may
   
   
    
   


“must i go and empty handed”
must i meet my saviour so
not one soul with which to greet him
must i empty handed go

    
   
    
 


loved with everlasting love
led by grace that love to know
spirit breathing from above
thou hast taught me it is so
  
  
  
    
  
o this full and perfect peace
from his presence all divine

in a love which cannot cease
i am his and he is mine   
   
  

    
     
heav’n above is softer blue
earth around is sweeter green
something lives in every hue
christless eyes have never seen
   
   
   
   
birds with gladder songs o’erflow
flow’rs with deeper beauties shine

since i know as i now know
i am his and he is mine   
  
    

   
     
things that once were wild alarms
cannot now disturb my rest
closed in everlasting arms
pillowed on the loving breast
   
   
    
     
o to lie forever here
doubt and care and self resign

while he whispers in my ear
i am his and he is mine   
    
   

    
     
his forever only his
who the lord and me shall part
ah with what a rest of bliss
christ can fill the loving heart
   
   
     
    

heav’n and earth may fade and flee
first-born light in gloom decline

but while god and i shall be
i am his and he is mine   
   
    

    
     


deeper than the deepest of the oceans
everlasting deep beyond compare
higher than the highest lights of heaven
is the love that christ with us does share
    
    
  
     
  

he has cleansed me from sin’s blight
and given me robes of pure white
and his holy spirit gave to me
i now am in his family

   
   
   
   

dark and fearful striking me with terror
were the years that i had spent in sin
i was lost unfortunate and hopeless
jesus found me and he took me in
   
     
   
     

he has cleansed me from sin’s blight
and given me robes of pure white
and his holy spirit gave to me
i now am in his family

   
   
   
   

praise the lord for by the grace of jesus
i am saved from sin and death set free
over me sin has no more dominion
jesus christ my saviour dwells in me
   
     
    
     


he has cleansed me from sin’s blight
and given me robes of pure white
and his holy spirit gave to me
i now am in his family

the love of god is greater far
than tongue or pen can ever tell
it goes beyond the highest star
and reaches to the lowest hell
    
  
    
   
   

the guilty pair bowed down with care
god gave his son to win
his erring child he reconciled
and pardoned from his sin
     
    
    
  

o love of god how rich and pure
how measureless and strong
it shall forevermore endure
the saints’ and angels’ song

  
  
   
   

when years of time shall pass away
and earthly thrones and kingdoms fall
when men who here refuse to pray
on rocks and hills and mountains call
   
  
  
   

god’s love so sure shall still endure
all measureless and strong
redeeming grace to adam’s race
the saints’ and angels’ song
    
  
    
   

o love of god how rich and pure
how measureless and strong
it shall forevermore endure
the saints’ and angels’ song

  
  
   
   

could we with ink the ocean fill
and were the skies of parchment made
were ev’ry stalk on earth a quill
and ev’ry man a scribe by trade
    
   
      
   

to write the love of god above
would drain the ocean dry
nor could the scroll contain the whole
tho’ stretched from sky to sky

give me the wings of faith to rise
within the veil to see
the saints above how great their joys
how bright their glories be
  
    
  
    
   

many are the friends who are waiting today
happy on the golden strand
many are the voices calling us away
to join their glorious band

    
   
    
  

once they were mourners here below
and poured out cries and tears
they wrestled hard as we do now
with sins and doubts and fears
    
   
   
  

many are the friends who are waiting today
happy on the golden strand
many are the voices calling us away
to join their glorious band

    
   
    
  

i asked them whence their vict’ry came
they with united breath
ascribe their conquest to the lamb
their triumph to his death
    
  
    
   


many are the friends who are waiting today
happy on the golden strand
many are the voices calling us away
to join their glorious band

heavenward heavenward
i now lift my eyes
for god has promised rest for all
who enter paradise
   
   
    
      

the days are long the battle fierce
and i must do my part
on earth i find no resting place
or healing for my heart
    
    
   
  

maybe soon very soon
i must take my flight
at last to enter into rest
my father’s house of light
   
  
    
   


what human eye has never seen
no human ear has heard
what human mind could not conceive
god promised in his word

you chose the cross with ev’ry breath
the perfect life the perfect death
you chose the cross

a crown of thorns you wore for us
and crowned us with eternal life
you chose the cross

and though your soul
was overwhelmed with pain
obedient to death you overcame
  you chose the cross


i’m lost in wonder
i’m lost in love
i’m lost in praise for evermore

because of jesus’ unfailing love
i am forgiven
i am restored
you loosed the cords of sinfulness
and broke the chains of my disgrace
you chose the cross

up from the grave victorious
you rose again so glorious
you chose the cross

the sorrow that surrounded you
was mine
“yet not my will but yours be done”
you said



i’m lost in wonder
i’m lost in love
i’m lost in praise for evermore

because of jesus’ unfailing love
i am forgiven
i am restored


there’s a dear and precious book
though it’s worn and faded now
which recalls those happy days of long ago
when i stood at mother’s knee
with her hand upon my brow
and i heard her voice in gentle tones and low
-     
   
   
   
    
   
    


blessd book precious book
on thy dear old tear stained leaves i love to look
thou art sweeter day by day
as i walk the narrow way
that leads at last to that bright home above

   
     
   
    
       

then she read of jesus’ love
as he blessed the children dear
how he suffered bled and died upon the tree
of his heavy load of care
then she dried my flowing tears
with her kisses as she said it was for me

well those days are past and gone
but their memory lingers still
and the dear old book each day has been
my guide
and i seek to do his will
as my mother taught me then
and ever in my heart his words abide

lead me to calvary
 
   
  
     
  

lest i forget gethsemane
lest i forget thine agony
lest i forget thy love for me
lead me to calvary

    
    
     
  

show me the tomb where thou wast laid
tenderly mourned and wept
angels in robes of light arrayed
guarded thee whilst thou slept
     
 
    
 

lest i forget gethsemane
lest i forget thine agony
lest i forget thy love for me
lead me to calvary

    
    
     
  

let me like mary through the gloom
come with a gift to thee
show to me now the empty tomb
lead me to calvary
    
  
     
  

lest i forget gethsemane
lest i forget thine agony
lest i forget thy love for me
lead me to calvary

    
    
     
  

may i be willing lord to bear
daily my cross for thee
even thy cup of grief to share
thou hast borne all for me
   
  
   
    


lest i forget gethsemane
lest i forget thine agony
lest i forget thy love for me
lead me to calvary

o boundless salvation deep ocean of love
o fullness of mercy christ brought from above
the whole world redeeming so rich and so free
now flowing for all men
come roll over me
    
    
     
      
   
 

my sins they are many their stains are so deep
and bitter the tears of remorse that i weep
but useless is weeping thou great crimson sea
thy waters can cleanse me
come roll over me
      
     
      
  
  
my tempers are fitful my passions are strong
they bind my poor soul and they force
me to wrong
beneath thy blest billows deliverance i see
o come mighty ocean
and roll over me
    
     
      
 
 
now tossed with temptation then haunted
with fears
my life has been joyless and useless for years
i feel something better most surely would be
if once thy pure waters
would roll over me
     
     
     
   
   

the tide is now flowing i’m touching the wave
i hear the loud call of the mighty to save
my faith’s growing bolder delivered i’ll be
i plunge ’neath the waters
they roll over me
      
      
       
   
  


and now hallelujah the rest of my days
shall gladly be spent in promoting his praise
who opened his bosom to pour out this sea
of boundless salvation

both in shade and shine will grow
and will keep our hearts aglow
while the days are going by

when the storms of life are raging
tempests wild on sea and land
i will seek a place of refuge
in the shadow of god’s hand
    
    
  
   
  

he will hide me he will hide me
where no harm can e’er betide me
he will hide me safely hide me
in the shadow of his hand

   
   
  
   

enemies may strive to injure
satan all his arts employ
he will turn what seems to harm me
into everlasting joy
   
  
   
    

he will hide me he will hide me
where no harm can e’er betide me
he will hide me safely hide me
in the shadow of his hand

   
   
  
   

tho’ he may send some affliction
’twill but make me long for home
for in love and not in anger
all his chastenings will come
    
    
   
   

he will hide me he will hide me
where no harm can e’er betide me
he will hide me safely hide me
in the shadow of his hand

   
   
  
   

so while here the cross i’m bearing
meeting storms and billows wild
jesus for my soul is caring
naught can harm his father’s child
    
   
    
    


he will hide me he will hide me
where no harm can e’er betide me
he will hide me safely hide me
in the shadow of his hand

   
   
  
   

sweet hour of prayer
sweet hour of prayer
that calls me from a world of care
and bids me at my father’s throne
make all my wants and wishes known
 
   
   
   
  
in seasons of distress and grief
my soul has often found relief
and oft escaped the tempter’s snare
by thy return sweet hour of prayer
    
   
    
    
sweet hour of prayer
sweet hour of prayer
thy wings shall my petition bear
to him whose truth and faithfulness
engage the waiting soul to bless
   
    
     
   
and since he bids me seek his face
believe his word and trust his grace
i’ll cast on him my ev’ry care
and wait for thee sweet hour of prayer
   
    
   
    
sweet hour of prayer
sweet hour of prayer
may i thy consolation share
’til from mount pisgah’s lofty height
i view my home and take my flight
   
    
   
    

this robe of flesh i’ll drop and rise
to seize the everlasting prize
and shout while passing through the air
farewell farewell sweet hour of prayer
   
     
    
   


i can hear my saviour calling
i can hear my saviour calling
i can hear my saviour calling
“take thy cross and follow follow me”
  
  
  
  
  
   

where he leads me i will follow
where he leads me i will follow
where he leads me i will follow
i’ll go with him with him all the way
    
    
    
     

i’ll go with him through the garden
i’ll go with him through the garden
i’ll go with him through the garden
i’ll go with him with him all the way
     
     
     
     

i’ll go with him through the judgement
i’ll go with him through the judgement
i’ll go with him through the judgement
i’ll go with him with him all the way
    
    
    
   

he will give me grace and glory
he will give me grace and glory
he will give me grace and glory
and go with me with me all the way

i shall go there to dwell in that city i know
since jesus came into my heart
and i’m happy so happy as onward i go

children of the heavenly father
safely in his bosom gather
nestling bird nor star in heaven
such a refuge e’er was given
    
    
   
     
   

god his own doth tend and nourish
in his holy courts they flourish
from all evil things he spares them
in his mighty arms he bears them
   
  
  
    

neither life nor death shall ever
from the lord his children sever
unto them his grace he showeth
and their sorrows all he knoweth
     
   
    
   

praise the lord in joyful numbers
your protector never slumbers
at the will of your defender
ev’ry foeman must surrender
   
   
    
  


though he giveth or he taketh
god his children ne’er forsaketh
his the loving purpose solely
to preserve them pure and holy

lead kindly light amid th’ encircling
gloom lead thou me on
the night is dark and i am far from
home lead thou me on
  
     
  
     
 

keep thou my feet
i do not ask to see
the distant scene
one step enough for me
  
  
 
    

i was not ever thus nor prayed
that thou shouldst lead me on
i loved to choose and see my path
but now lead thou me on
      
 
      
 

i loved the garish day
and spite of fears
pride ruled my will
remember not past years
 
    
 
  

so long thy power hath blest me
sure it still will lead me on
o’er moor and fen o’er crag and torrent
till the night is gone
      
 
     
  


and with the morn
those angel-faces smile
which i have loved
long since and lost awhile
  
  
 
  


on the shore of jordan’s river
in expectation we all stand
there by faith we see the shimmer
of our new and promised land
   
   
   
   
   

let us live in expectation
of that moment when the lord
will receive us into his kingdom
as he promised in his word

   
   
    
   

like the sun in radiant glory
glows the new jerusalem
songs of praises tell the story
of that precious priceless gem
    
  
   
  

let us live in expectation
of that moment when the lord
will receive us into his kingdom
as he promised in his word

   
   
    
   

many saints their race have finished
crossed the jordan with a prayer
and we too shall cross that river
very soon we’ll all be there
   
   
   
    

let us live in expectation
of that moment when the lord
will receive us into his kingdom
as he promised in his word

   
   
    
   

shades of death engulf the river
but beyond its deathly throes
lies the kingdom of the blessed
and the end of all our woes
   
   
  
    


let us live in expectation
of that moment when the lord
will receive us into his kingdom
as he promised in his word

and he’s the one i’m waiting for
every day with jesus
is sweeter than the day before
  
    
   
   


am i a soldier of the cross
a follower of the lamb
and shall i fear to own his cause
or blush to speak his name
     
     
   
     
   

must i be carried to the skies
on flowery beds of ease
while others fought to win the prize
and sailed through bloody seas
    
    
     
    

are there no foes for me to face
must i not stem the flood
is this vile world a friend to grace
to help me on to god
    
     
   
   


sure i must fight if i would reign
increase my courage lord
i’ll bear the toil endure the pain
supported by thy word
    
    
      
      


teach me lord how to pray in contrition
and your holy commands to fulfil
free my heart from its pride and ambition
may it always conform to your will
may it always conform to your will
   
   
   
   
    
    

may you reign in my heart without measure
and your spirit my spirit control
may in you i find all of my pleasure
and your name in my heart thus extol
and your name in my heart thus extol
     
     
    
    
    


cleansed within by the blood of my saviour
may my heart be kept free from all sin
may it find its delight and its favour
as it loves both my foes and my kin
as it loves both my foes and my kin
   
    
   
    
    


work for the night is coming
work through the morning hours
work while the dew is sparkling
work ’mid springing flowers
  
  
   
  
 

work when the day grows brighter
work in the glowing sun
work for the night is coming
when man’s work is done
  
    
   
  

work for the night is coming
work through the sunny noon
fill brightest hours with labour
rest comes sure and soon
   
   
  
  

give every flying minute
something to keep in store
work for the night is coming
when man works no more
    
  
   
  

work for the night is coming
under the sunset skies
while their bright tints are glowing
work for daylight flies
  
   
   
 

work till the last beam fadeth
fadeth to shine no more
work while the night is darkening
when man’s work is o’er

and be washed in the blood of the lamb

or blush to speak his name
     



     
   
    
   

  
   
    
    
  
   
  

   
   
  
   
  

must i be carried to the skies
on flowery beds of ease
while others fought to win the prize
and sailed through bloody seas

repeat from start   
  through our god

rock of ages cleft for me
let me hide myself in thee
let the water and the blood
from thy wounded side which flowed
be of sin the double cure
save from wrath and make me pure
 
 
  
   
     
   
   
not the labour of my hands
can fulfil thy law’s demands
could my zeal no respite know
could my tears forever flow
all for sin could not atone
thou must save and thou alone
    
    
  
   
    
    
nothing in my hand i bring
simply to the cross i cling
naked come to thee for dress
helpless look to thee for grace
foul i to the fountain fly
wash me saviour or i die
     
     
     
    
    
    

while i draw this fleeting breath
when my eyes shall close in death
while i rise to worlds unknown
and behold thee on thy throne
rock of ages cleft for me
let me hide myself in thee

of the coming of the lord

by the dim and flaring lamps
his day is marching on

no shelter or help is nigh
  
  
   
   
    
carest thou not that we perish
how canst thou lie asleep
when each moment so madly
is threatening
a grave in the angry deep
   
   
    
  

the winds and the waves

whether the wrath of the storm tossed sea
or demons or men or whatever it be

there is a green hill far away
outside a city wall
where the dear lord was crucified
who died to save us all
   
    
  
     
   

o dearly dearly has he loved
and we must love him too
and trust in his redeeming blood
and try his works to do

   
  
  
   

we may not know we cannot tell
what pains he had to bear
but we believe it was for us
he hung and suffered there
  
   
     
   

o dearly dearly has he loved
and we must love him too
and trust in his redeeming blood
and try his works to do

   
  
  
   

he died that we might be forgiv’n
he died to make us good
that we might go at last to heav’n
saved by his precious blood
   
   
    
   

o dearly dearly has he loved
and we must love him too
and trust in his redeeming blood
and try his works to do

   
  
  
   

there was no other good enough
to pay the price of sin
he only could unlock the gate
of heaven and let us in
   
  
   
  


o dearly dearly has he loved
and we must love him too
and trust in his redeeming blood
and try his works to do

   
  
  
   




he is lord he is lord
he is risen from the dead
and he is lord
every knee shall bow
every tongue confess
that jesus christ is lord
he is lord


you stood before creation
eternity in your hand
you spoke the earth into motion
my soul now to stand

you stood before my failure
and carried the cross for my shame
my sin weighed upon your shoulders
my soul now to stand
  you stood before creation



so what can i say

amazing grace how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me
i once was lost but now am found
was blind but now i see
     
   
   
      
     

’twas grace that taught my heart to fear
and grace my fears relieved
how precious did that grace appear
the hour i first believed
   
   
     
   

thro’ many dangers toils and snares
i have already come
’tis grace that brought me safe thus far
and grace will lead me home
    
   
     
  

the earth shall soon dissolve like snow
the sun forbear to shine
but god who called me here below
shall be forever mine
   
    
       
   

yea when this flesh and heart shall fail
and mortal life shall cease
i shall possess within the veil
a life of joy and peace
    
  
    
   

when we’ve been there
ten thousand years
bright shining as the sun
we’ve no less days to sing god’s praise
than when we first begun
   
  
    
    

in tenderness he sought me
weary and sick with sin
and on his shoulders brought me
back to his fold again
while angels in his presence sang
until the courts of heaven rang
   
 
  
   
   
    
    

oh the love that sought me
oh the blood that bought me
oh the grace that brought me to the fold
wondrous grace that brought me to the fold

  
  
  
  
he washed the bleeding sin wounds
and poured in oil and wine
he whispered to assure me
“i’ve found thee thou art mine”
i never heard a sweeter voice
it made my aching heart rejoice
  
   
  
    
   
   

oh the love that sought me
oh the blood that bought me
oh the grace that brought me to the fold
wondrous grace that brought me to the fold

  
  
  
  
he pointed to the nail prints
for me his blood was shed
a mocking crown so thorny
was placed upon his head
i wondered what he saw in me
to suffer such deep agony
   
   
 
  
    
     

oh the love that sought me
oh the blood that bought me
oh the grace that brought me to the fold
wondrous grace that brought me to the fold

  
  
  
  
i’m sitting in his presence
the sunshine of his face
while with adoring wonder
his blessings i retrace
it seems as if eternal days
are far too short to sound his praise
  
     
  
    
   
     

oh the love that sought me
oh the blood that bought me
oh the grace that brought me to the fold
wondrous grace that brought me to the fold

  
  
  
  
so while the hours are passing
all now is perfect rest
i’m waiting for the morning
the brightest and the best
when he will call us to his side
to be with him his spotless bride
   
   
 
   
    
    


oh the love that sought me
oh the blood that bought me
oh the grace that brought me to the fold
wondrous grace that brought me to the fold

but gather them all for the home on high
   
    
     
    

where are the reapers o who will come
and share in the glory of the “harvest home”

where are the reapers o who will come
and share in the glory of the “harvest home”
o who will help us to garner in

so come with your sickles ye sons of men
and gather together the golden grain
oil on till the lord of the harvest come
hen share ye his joy in the “harvest home”

amazing grace how sweet the sound
hat saved a wretch like me
i once was lost but now am found
was blind but now i see

’twas grace that taught my heart to fear
and grace my fears relieved
how precious did that grace appear
he hour i first believed
  amazing grace



my chains are gone i’ve been set free
my god my saviour has ransomed me
and like a flood his mercy reigns
unending love amazing grace



he lord has promised good to me
his word my hope secures
he will my shield and portion be
as long as life endures



my chains are gone i’ve been set free
my god my saviour has ransomed me
and like a flood his mercy reigns
unending love amazing grace





he earth shall soon dissolve like snow
he sun forbear to shine
but god who called me here below
will be forever mine


one day when heaven was filled with his praises
one day when sin was as black as could be
jesus came forth to be born of a virgin
dwelt among men my example is he
  

    
     
     
     

living he loved me dying he saved me
buried he carried my sins far away
rising he justified freely forever
one day he’s comingo glorious day

      
     
   
  
     

one day they led him up calvary’s mountain
one day they nailed him to die on the tree
suffering anguish despised and rejected
bearing our sins my redeemer is he

    
    
      
     

living he loved me dying he saved me
buried he carried my sins far away
rising he justified freely forever
one day he’s comingo glorious day

      
     
   
  
     

one day they left him alone in the garden
one day he rested from suffering free
angels came down o’er his tomb to keep vigil
hope of the hopeless my saviour is he

     
    
      
    

living he loved me dying he saved me
buried he carried my sins far away
rising he justified freely forever
one day he’s comingo glorious day

      
     
   
  
     

one day the grave could conceal him no longer
one day the stone rolled away from the door
hen he arose over death he had conquered
now is ascended my lord evermore

   
   
    
    

living he loved me dying he saved me
buried he carried my sins far away
rising he justified freely forever
one day he’s comingo glorious day

      
     
   
  
     

one day the trumpet will sound for his coming
one day the skies with his glory will shine
wonderful day my beloved ones bringing
glorious saviour this jesus is mine

   
     
    
     


living he loved me dying he saved me
buried he carried my sins far away
rising he justified freely forever
one day he’s comingo glorious day

i stand amazed in the presence
of jesus the nazarene
and wonder how he could love me
a sinner condemned unclean


o how marvellous o how wonderful
and my song shall ever be
o how marvellous o how wonderful
is my saviour’s love for me
i stand amazed
for me it was in the garden
he prayed “not my will but thine”
he had no tears for his own griefs
but sweat drops of blood for mine


o how marvellous o how wonderful
and my song shall ever be
o how marvellous o how wonderful
is my saviour’s love for me
in pity angels beheld him
and came from the world of light
o comfort him in the sorrows
he bore for my soul that night


o how marvellous o how wonderful
and my song shall ever be
o how marvellous o how wonderful
is my saviour’s love for me
he took my sins and my sorrows
he made them his very own
he bore the burden to calvary
and suffered and died alone


o how marvellous o how wonderful
and my song shall ever be
o how marvellous o how wonderful
is my saviour’s love for me

when with the ransomed in glory
his face i at last shall see
’twill be my joy through the ages
o sing of his love for me


o how marvellous o how wonderful
and my song shall ever be
o how marvellous o how wonderful
is my saviour’s love for me


beneath the cross of jesus
i fain would take my stand
he shadow of a mighty rock
within a weary land
  
  
  
    
   

a home within the wilderness
a rest upon the way
from the burning of the noontide heat
and the burden of the day
   
  
   
   

o safe and happy shelter
o refuge tried and sweet
o trysting place where heaven’s love
and heaven’s justice meet
  
 
     
  

as to the holy patriarch
hat wondrous dream was given
so seems my saviour’s cross to me
a ladder up to heaven
    
  
    
    

upon the cross of jesus
mine eyes at times can see
he very dying form of one
who suffered there for me
   
    
  
   

and from my stricken heart with tears
wo wonders i confess
he wonders of redeeming love
and my unworthiness
   
  
  
  

i take o cross thy shadow
for my abiding place
i ask no other sunshine than
he sunshine of his face
   
  
     
   


content to let the world go by
o know no gain nor loss
my sinful self my only shame
my glory all the cross
   
   
   
  


make me a captive lord
and then i shall be free
force me to render up my sword
and i shall conqueror be
   
   
     
 
  

i sink in life’s alarms
when by myself i stand
imprison me within thine arms
and strong shall be my hand
  
   
   
   

my heart is weak and poor
until its master find
it has no spring of action sure
it varies with the wind
  
  
      
  

it cannot freely move
ill thou hast wrought its chain
enslave it with thy matchless love
and deathless it shall reign
   
   
   
  

my power is faint and low
ill i have learned to serve
it wants the needed fire to glow
it wants the breeze to nerve
   
    
    
   

it cannot drive the world
until itself be driv’n
its flag can only be unfurled
when thou shalt breathe from heav’n
   
   
   
 

my will is not my own
ill thou hast made it thine
if it would reach a monarch’s throne
it must its crown resign
   
  
     
  


it only stands unbent
amid the clashing strife
when on thy bosom it has leant
and found in thee its life
  
   
    
    


o think of the home over there
by the side of the river of light
where the saints all immortal and fair
are robed in their garments of light
-     
   
     
    
  

over there over there
o think of the home over there
over there over there
o think of the home over there

   
   
   
   

my saviour is now over there
here my kindred and friends are at rest
hen away from my sorrow and care
let me fly to the land of the blest
    
    
    
    

over there over there
o think of the home over there
over there over there
o think of the home over there

   
   
   
   

i’ll soon be at home over there
for the end of my journey i see
many dear to my heart over there
are watching and waiting for me
    
   
     
    


over there over there
o think of the home over there
over there over there
o think of the home over there

was spilled
   

   
     
     
      

grace grace god’s grace
grace that will pardon and cleanse within
grace grace god’s grace
grace that is greater than all our sin

will receive us into his kingdom

all his ransomed home to bring
hen anew this song we’ll sing

by night

he angel of the lord came down
and glory shone around

“fear not” said he for mighty dread
had seized their troubled mind
“glad tidings of great joy i bring
o you and all mankind
  while shepherds watched

“to you in david’s town this day
is born of david’s line
a saviour who is christ the lord
and this shall be the sign

“the heav’nly babe you there shall find
o human view displayed
all meanly wrapped in swathing bands
and in a manger laid”


hus spake the seraph and forthwith
appeared a shining throng
of angels praising god who thus
addressed their joyful song

“all glory be to god on high
and to the earth be peace
goodwill henceforth from heav’n to earth
begin and never cease”

his work is perfect
and all his ways are just

a god of faithfulness and
without injustice
good and upright is he

for god by grace shall dwell in thee
and god himself is light

you can tell the love of jesus
you can say he died for all

with the judgement’s dread alarms
you can lead the little children
o the saviour’s waiting arms

“there is nothing i can do”
while the lost of earth are dying
and the master calls for you

let his work your pleasure be
answer quickly when he calls you
“here am i send me send me”

hat shadows a dry thirsty land
he hideth my life in the depths of his love
and covers me there with his hand
and covers me there with his hand

“must i go and empty handed”
hus my dear redeemer meet
not one day of service give him
lay no trophy at his feet
-       
     
  
    
   

“must i go and empty handed”
must i meet my saviour so
not one soul with which to greet him
must i empty handed go

     
  
    
 

not at death i shrink or falter
for my saviour saves me now
but to meet him empty handed
hought of that now clouds my brow
    
    
   
     ’

“must i go and empty handed”
must i meet my saviour so
not one soul with which to greet him
must i empty handed go

     
  
    
 

o the years in sinning wasted
could i but recall them now
i would give them to my saviour
o his will i’d gladly bow
     
    
    
  

“must i go and empty handed”
must i meet my saviour so
not one soul with which to greet him
must i empty handed go

     
  
    
 

o ye saints arouse be earnest
up and work while yet ’tis day
ere the night of death o’ertake thee
strive for souls while still you may
   
  
  
   


“must i go and empty handed”
must i meet my saviour so
not one soul with which to greet him
must i empty handed go

in christ alone my hope is found
he is my light my strength my song
this cornerstone this solid ground
firm through the fiercest drought and storm

what heights of love what depths of peace
when fears are stilled when strivings cease
my comforter my all in all
here in the love of christ i stand
  in christ alone

in christ alonewho took on flesh
fullness of god in helpless babe
his gift of love and righteousness
scorned by the ones he came to save

ill on the cross as jesus died
he wrath of god was satisfied
for ev’ry sin on him was laid
here in the death of christ i live

here in the ground his body lay
light of the world by darkness slain
hen bursting forth in glorious day
up from the grave he rose again

and as he stands in victory
sin’s curse has lost its grip on me
for i am his and he is mine
bought with the precious blood of christ


no guilt in life no fear in death
his is the pow’r of christ in me
from life’s first cry to final breath
jesus commands my destiny

no pow’r of hell no scheme of man
can ever pluck me from his hand
ill he returns or calls me home
here in the pow’r of christ i’ll stand


jesus is coming to earth again
what if it were today
coming in power and love to reign

ill death shall set me free
and then go home my crown to wear
for there’s a crown for me

at jesus’ piercd feet
joyful i’ll cast my golden crown
and his dear name repeat

i was sinking deep in sin
far from the peaceful shore
very deeply stained within
sinking to rise no more
     
   
    
  
  

but the master of the sea
heard my despairing cry
from the waters lifted me
now safe am i
   
  
    
  

love lifted me
love lifted me
when nothing else could help
love lifted me

 
 
   
 

all my heart to him i give
ever to him i’ll cling
in his blessed presence live
ever his praises sing
  
    
   
  

love so mighty and so true
merits my soul’s best songs
faithful loving service too
o him belongs
    
  
   
  

love lifted me
love lifted me
when nothing else could help
love lifted me

 
 
   
 

souls in danger look above
jesus completely saves
he will lift you by his love
out of the angry waves
 
  
  
  

he’s the master of the sea
billows his will obey
he your saviour wants to be
be saved today
     
  
    
  


love lifted me
love lifted me
when nothing else could help
love lifted me  

 
 
   
   


hough i may speak with
he language of angels
and though i may fathom
all mysteries

see into the future
have faith that moves mountains
if i am without love
hen what does it mean
  though i may speak



without love
it’s nothing at all
without love
without love
it’s nothing at all

and even if i gave
he poor my possessions
surrendered my body
and died for the cause

hough highly respected
successful and gifted
if love was excluded
i’ve wasted it all



without love
it’s nothing at all
without love
without love
it’s nothing at all

and when we pass through the fire
nothing but love will survive


without love
it’s nothing at all
without love
without love
it’s nothing at all




and with you
jesus we see love
nothing but love will survive

and i will be healed
save me and i will be saved

heal me o lord
and i will be healed
for you are the one i praise
you are the one i praise
  heal me o lord


o that i had a thousand voices
and with a thousand tongues could tell
of him in whom the earth rejoices
who does all things wisely and well
      
      
   
   
    

my grateful heart would then be free
o tell what god has done for me
     
       
o all you pow’rs that god implanted
arise and silence keep no more
put forth the strength that god has
granted
your noblest work is to adore
      
    
     
     

o soul and body join to raise
with heartfelt joy our maker’s praise
    
   

you forest leaves so green and tender
hat dance for joy in summer air
you meadow grasses bright and slender
you flow’rs so wond’rous sweet so fair
   
  
    
     

you live to show god’s praise alone
with me now make his glory known
   
    
all creatures that have breath and
motion
hat throng the earth the sea the sky
now join with me my heart’s devotion
help me to raise his praises high
    
   
    
    

my utmost pow’rs can ne’er aright
declare the wonders of god’s might
    
    
   
  
     
  

o father deign thou i beseech thee
o listen to my earthly lays
a nobler strain in heav’n shall reach thee
when i with angels hymn thy praise

    
    

and learn amid their choirs to sing
loud hallelujahs to my king


love divine all loves excelling
joy of heav’n to earth come down
fix in us thy humble dwelling
all thy faithful mercies crown
   
 
  
    
    

jesus thou art all compassion
pure unbounded love thou art
visit us with thy salvation
enter ev’ry trembling heart
   
  
    
   

breathe o breathe thy loving spirit
into ev’ry troubled breast
let us all in thee inherit
let us find thy promised rest
   
   
  
  

ake away our bent to sinning
alpha and omega be
end of faith as its beginning
set our hearts at liberty
    
  
   
   

come almighty to deliver
let us all thy life receive
suddenly return and never
nevermore thy temples leave
   
   
  
   

hee we would be always blessing
serve thee as thy hosts above
pray and praise thee without ceasing
glory in thy perfect love
    
    
  
  

finish then thy new creation
pure and spotless let us be
let us see thy great salvation
perfectly restored in thee
   
 
    
  


changed from glory into glory
’til in heav’n we take our place
ill we cast our crowns before thee
lost in wonder love and praise
    
   
   
 


“almost persuaded”
now to believe
“almost persuaded”
christ to receive
 
 
  
  
 

seems now some soul to say
“go spirit go thy way
some more convenient day
on thee i’ll call”
 -  
  
   
  

“almost persuaded”
come come today
“almost persuaded”
urn not away
  
  
  
  

jesus invites you here
angels are lingering near
prayers rise from hearts so dear
o wanderer come
  
  
   
 

“almost persuaded”
harvest is past
“almost persuaded”
doom comes at last
  
 
  
 


“almost” cannot avail
“almost” is but to fail
sad sad that bitter wail
“almost” but lost
   
  
   
  


an open bible for the world

blest word of god send forth thy light
o’er every land and every sea

blest word of god send forth thy light
o’er every land and every sea
ill all who wander in the night

all radiant with forgiving love
and to the lost of adam’s race
proclaims sweet mercy from above
  
    
   
   

blest word of god send forth thy light
o’er every land and every sea
ill all who wander in the night
are led to god and heaven by thee

it comforts those who sit in tears
o all who faint it strength imparts
and gilds with hope th’ eternal years
    
    
     
  


blest word of god send forth thy light
o’er every land and every sea

as news of your impending death
o your disciples broke
and lovingly you took the bread
and words of blessing spoke
-    
  
   
  ’  
  
he bread you broke and with these
words
distributed to all
“this is my bodytake and eat
partake of it all of you”
  
  
„      
  ”

and then o lord you took the cup
and prayed and then you said
“this is my bloodby it for sins
atonement will be made”
     
„   
  ”   
„    ”

“this is the covenant of blood
no other can there be
whene’er you do it do it in
remembrance friends of me”
„     
   
    
   ”

your blood we would remember lord
for us shed on the tree
your mutilated body too
o let us ever see
    
    
    
    


possess our thoughts that ever we
may seek the reason why
why you on calv’ry’s rugged cross
chose such a death to die
    
   
     
  


on a hill far away
stood an old rugged cross
he emblem of suffering and shame
and i love that old cross
where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain
  

      
    
      
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
ill my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

     
    
      
     

oh that old rugged cross
so despised by the world
has a wondrous attraction for me
for the dear lamb of god left his glory above
o bear it to dark calvary
       
      
       
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
ill my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

     
    
      
     

o the old rugged cross i will ever be true
it’s shame and reproach gladly bear
hen he’ll call me some day
o my home far away
where his glory forever i’ll share
       
   
      
    


so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
ill my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

     
    
      
     


i grieved my lord from day to day
i scorned his love so full and free
and though i wandered far away
my mother’s prayers have followed me
   
   
    
     
  

i’m coming home i’m coming home
o live my wasted life anew
for mother’s prayers have followed me
have followed me the whole world thro’

    
   
     
  

o’er desert wild o’er mountain high
a wanderer i chose to be
a wretched soul condemned to die
still mother’s prayers have followed me
     
     
  
  

i’m coming home i’m coming home
o live my wasted life anew
for mother’s prayers have followed me
have followed me the whole world thro’

    
   
     
  

he turned my darkness into light
his blessd christ of calvary
i’ll praise his name both day and night
hat mother’s prayers have followed me
    
    
    
  


i’m coming home i’m coming home
o live my wasted life anew
for mother’s prayers have followed me
have followed me the whole world thro’

    
   
     
  


i love to think of the heavenly land
where white-robed angels are
where many a friend is gathered safe
from fear and toil and care
    
    
  
    
  

here’ll be no parting
here’ll be no parting
here’ll be no parting
here’ll be no parting there

  
  
  
   

i love to think of the heavenly land
where my redeemer reigns
where rapturous songs of triumph rise
in endless joyous strains
    
   
    
  

here’ll be no parting
here’ll be no parting
here’ll be no parting
here’ll be no parting there

  
  
  
   
i love to think of the heavenly land
he saints’ eternal home
where palms and robes and crowns
ne’er fade
and all our joys are one
    
  
    
  

here’ll be no parting
here’ll be no parting
here’ll be no parting
here’ll be no parting there

here’ll be no parting
here’ll be no parting there

  
  
  
   


i know not why god’s wond’rous grace
o me he hath made known
nor why unworthy christ in love
redeemed me for his own
   
   
  
   
    

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
o keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

      
     
    
    

i know not how this saving faith
o me he did impart
nor how believing in his word
wrought peace within my heart
     
   
     
 

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
o keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

      
     
    
    

i know not how the spirit moves
convincing men of sin
revealing jesus through the word
creating faith in him
     
   
    
  

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
o keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

      
     
    
    

i know not what of good or ill
may be reserved for me
of weary ways or golden days
before his face i see
      
 
     
  

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
o keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

      
     
    
    

i know not when my lord may come
at night or noonday fair
nor if i’ll walk the vale with him
or meet him in the air
    
  
      
    


but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
o keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

when i survey the wondrous cross
on which the prince of glory died
my richest gain i count but loss
and pour contempt on all my pride
   
   
     
   
   

forbid it lord that i should boast
save in the death of christ my god
all the vain things that charm me most
i sacrifice them to his blood
    
     
     
   

see from his head his hands his feet
sorrow and love flow mingled down
did e’er such love and sorrow meet
or thorns compose so rich a crown
   
     
   
   


were the whole realm of nature mine
hat were a present far too small
love so amazing so divine
demands my soul my life my all
     
      
      
    




sing unto the lord a new song
sing unto the lord all the earth

jesus taught us how to live in harmony

jesus taught us how to be a family
jesus taught us how to be a family
loving one another with the love
hat he gives
jesus taught us how to be a family

jesus turned our sorrow into dancing
jesus turned our sorrow into dancing
changed our tears of sadness into
rivers of joy
jesus turned our sorrow into a dance


crown him with many crowns
he lamb upon his throne
hark how the heavenly anthem drowns
all music but its own
  
  
   
   
  

awake my soul and sing
of him who died for thee
and hail him as thy matchless king
hrough all eternity
   
   
 ―   
 ―   

crown him the lord of love
behold his hands and side
rich wounds yet visible above
in beauty glorified
  
  
    
    

no angel in the sky
can fully bear that sight
but downward bends his wondering eye
at mysteries so bright
  
   
   
     

crown him the lord of life
who triumphed o’er the grave
who rose victorious to the strife
for those he came to save
  
  
    
  

his glories now we sing
who died and rose on high
who died eternal life to bring
and lives that death may die
   
  ―   
     
    

crown him the lord of heaven
one with the father known
one with the spirit through him given
from yonder glorious throne
  
  
    
   


all hail redeemer hail
for thou hast died for me
hy praise and glory shall not fail
hroughout eternity

and did my sovereign die
would he devote that sacred head
for sinners such as i
   
   
 
  
   

at the cross at the cross
where i first saw the light
and the burden of my heart rolled away
it was there by faith i received my sight

hy body slain sweet jesus thine
and bathed in its own blood

and the burden of my heart rolled away
it was there by faith i received my sight
and now i am happy all the day

and shut his glories in
when christ the mighty maker died
for man the creature’s sin

and the burden of my heart rolled away
it was there by faith i received my sight
and now i am happy all the day

   
  
     
    
     


hus might i hide my blushing face
while his dear cross appears
dissolve my heart in thankfulness
and melt my eyes to tears
    
   
    
  

at the cross at the cross
where i first saw the light
and the burden of my heart rolled away
it was there by faith i received my sight
and now i am happy all the day

when the soul waketh and life’s shadows flee

shades
does he care enough to be near

o resist some temptation strong
when for my deep grief i find no relief
hough my tears flow all the night long
      
    
      
    

o yes he cares i know he cares
his heart is touched with my grief
when the days are weary
he long nights dreary
i know my saviour cares

     
   
       
    

does jesus care when i’ve said goodbye
o the dearest on earth to me
and my sad heart aches till it nearly
breaks
is it aught to him does he see
      
   
     
      


o yes he cares i know he cares
his heart is touched with my grief
when the days are weary
he long nights dreary
i know my saviour cares

oppressed with various ills draw near

for some are sick and some are sad
and some have never loved thee well
and some have lost the love they had

hou has been troubled tempted tried
hy kind but searching glance can scan
he very wounds that shame would hide

his name the name of jesus
   
   
    
  


sweetest note in seraph song
sweetest name on mortal tongue
sweetest carol ever sung
jesus blessd jesus

    
    
    
 


come holy spirit heavenly dove
with all thy quick’ning powers
kindle a flame of sacred love
in these cold hearts of ours
   
     
  
    
  

in vain we tune our formal songs
in vain we strive to rise
hosannas languish on our tongues
and our devotion dies
   
  
     
  

dear lord and shall we ever live
at this poor dying rate
our love so faint so cold to thee
and thine to us so great
   
   
     
    


come holy spirit heavenly dove
with all thy quick’ning powers
come shed abroad the saviour’s love
and that shall kindle ours
     
   
    
   


o worship the king all glorious above
and gratefully sing his pow’r and his love
our shield and defender the ancient of days
pavilioned in splendour and girded with praise
    
   
      
     
   
o tell of his might and sing of his grace
whose robe is the light whose canopy space
his chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds
form
and dark is his path on the wings of the storm
    
      
      
   
hy bountiful care what tongue can recite
it breathes in the air it shines in the light
it streams from the hills it descends to
he plain
and sweetly distils in the dew and the rain
    
      
       
     


frail children of dust and feeble as frail
in thee do we trust nor find thee to fail
hy mercies how tender how firm to the end
our maker defender redeemer and friend

a mighty fortress is our god
a bulwark never failing
our helper he amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing
    
    
    
     
    
for still our ancient foe
doth seek to work us woe
his craft and power are great
and armed with cruel hate
on earth is not his equal
    
  
   
   
    

did we in our own strength confide
our striving would be losing
were not the right man on our side
he man of god’s own choosing
   
  
    
  
dost ask who that may be
christ jesus it is he
lord sabaoth his name
from age to age the same
and he must win the battle
   
  
    
       
 

and though this world with devils filled
should threaten to undo us
we will not fear for god hath willed
his truth to triumph through us
   
   
   
  
he prince of darkness grim
we tremble not for him
his rage we can endure
for lo his doom is sure
one little word shall fell him
    
   
   
   
  

hat word above all earthly powers
no thanks to them abideth
he spirit and the gifts are ours
hrough him who with us sideth
  
   
   
 

let goods and kindred go
his mortal life also
he body they may kill
god’s truth abideth still
his kingdom is forever

when i became a prodigal
and left the old roof-tree
she almost broke her loving heart
in mourning after me
    
    
   
   

and day and night she prayed to god
o keep me in his care
o saviour tell my mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there

it bade me quickly come
if i would see my mother
ere the saviour took her home
    
   
   
   

i promised her before she died
for heaven to prepare
o saviour tell my mother

o christ in thee my soul hath found
and found in thee alone
he peace the joy i sought so long
he bliss till now unknown
    
    
   
    
   

now none but christ can satisfy
none other name for me
here’s love and life and lasting joy

i yearned for them not thee
but while i passed my saviour by
his love laid hold on me
    
   
   
  

now none but christ can satisfy
none other name for me
here’s love and life and lasting joy
lord jesus found in thee

     
   
     
    

i tried the broken cisterns lord
but ah the waters failed
even as i stooped to drink they fled
and mocked me as i wailed
   
  
    
    

now none but christ can satisfy
none other name for me
here’s love and life and lasting joy
lord jesus found in thee

     
   
     
    

he pleasures lost i sadly mourned
but never wept for thee
ill grace the sightless eyes received
hy loveliness to see
   
   
     
   


now none but christ can satisfy
none other name for me
here’s love and life and lasting joy
lord jesus found in thee

it came upon the midnight clear
hat glorious song of old
from angels bending near the earth
o touch their harps of gold
  
    
   
   
   

“peace on the earth good will to men
from heaven’s all-gracious king”
he world in solemn stillness lay
o hear the angels sing
    
  
    
  

still thro’ the cloven skies they come
with peaceful wings unfurled
and still their heavenly music floats
o’er all the weary world
   
  
     
  

above its sad and lowly plains
hey bend on hovering wing
and ever o’er its babel sounds
he blessed angels sing
     
   
   
  

and ye beneath life’s crushing load
whose forms are bending low
who toil along the climbing way
with painful steps and slow
    
 
   
  

look now for glad and golden hours
come swiftly on the wing
o rest beside the weary road
and hear the angels sing
   
  
    
  

for lo the days are hastening on
by prophet bards foretold
when with the ever-circling years
comes round the age of gold
   
 
    
  


when peace shall over all the earth
its ancient splendours fling
and the whole world give back the song
which now the angels sing

hough troubles assail us
and dangers affright
hough friends should all fail us
and foes all unite
  
  
  
  
   ―

yet one thing secures us
whatever betide
he promise assures us
“the lord will provide”
   
 
 
 

he birds without garner
or storehouse are fed
from them let us learn to
rust god for our bread
   
  
   
   

his saints what is fitting
shall ne’er be denied
so long as ’tis written
“the lord will provide”
 
 
  
 

when satan assails us
o stop up our path
and courage all fails us
we triumph by faith
 
  
  
  

he cannot take from us
hough oft he has tried
his heart-cheering promise
“the lord will provide”
  
 
  
 

no strength of our own
and no goodness we claim
yet since we have known
of the saviour’s great name
  
    
  
  


in this our strong tower
for safety we hide
he lord is our power
“the lord will provide”

and the wounded made whole
and the captives set free and forgiven

i’ve found in the grace that flowed
to me in my unrighteousness

i have placed all my hope
in a crucified man
in the wounds in his side
his feet and his hands

i have traded my pride
for a share in his shame
and the glory that one day
will burst from his pain
  i have placed all my hope

i’ve abandoned my trust
in the wise and the proud
for this fragile mysterious
weakness of god

and i dare to believe
in his scandalous claim
hat his blood cleanses sin
for whoever will call on his name



live or die here i stand
i’ve placed my hope
in a crucified man

i believe as they beat
on his beautiful face
he turned a torturer’s chair
o an altar of grace

where the worst we can do
met the best that god does
where unspeakable hate
met the gaze of unstoppable love



at the crux of it all there he hangs
i’ve placed my hope in a crucified
man of sorrows man of grief
will he stay beyond belief

when the purest and best
ook the force of our curse
death’s vict’ry armada
juddered into reverse

and either we bow
or we stumble and fall
for the wisdom of a suffering god
has made fools of us all



i gladly admit that i am
but i’ve placed my hope in a crucified
man of sorrows man of grief
will he stay beyond belief

i have buried my life
in the cold earth with him
like a seed in the winter
i wait for the spring

from that garden of tombs
eden rises again
and paradise blooms
from his body and never will end



he’ll finish all he began
creation hopes
in a crucified man


when i stand at the judgement
i have no other plan
i’ve placed my hope
in a crucified man

like the thief nailed beside him
i have no other plan
i’ve placed my hope
in a crucified man

i belong to the king
i’m a child of his love
i shall dwell in his palace so fair
for he tells of its bliss
in yon heaven above
and his children in splendour shall share
  

  
   
      
  
  
    

i belong to the king i’m a child of his love
and he never forsaketh his own
he will call me some day to his palace above
i shall dwell by his glorified throne

  
   
    
     
    
     
i belong to the king
and he loves me i know
for his mercy and kindness so free
are unceasingly mine
wheresoever i go
and my refuge unfailing is he

  
  
     
 
      
       

i belong to the king i’m a child of his love
and he never forsaketh his own

i belong to the king
and his promise is sure
hat we all shall be gathered at last
in his kingdom above
by life’s waters so pure
when this life with its trials is past

  
  
      
  
   
    


i belong to the king i’m a child of his love

i know not why god’s wond’rous grace

redeemed me for his own
-

wrought peace within my heart

o keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

     
     
   
     

i know not when my lord may come

or meet him in the air

hou didst leave thy throne
and thy kingly crown
when thou camest to earth for me
but in bethlehem’s home
was there found no room
for thy holy nativity
  

      
   
      
   


o come to my heart lord jesus
here is room in my heart for thee

      
     

heaven’s arches rang when the angels sang
proclaiming thy royal decree
but of lowly birth didst thou come to earth
and in great humility
    
  
     
    


o come to my heart lord jesus
here is room in my heart for thee

      
     

hou camest o lord with the living word
hat should set thy people free
but with mocking scorn and with crown of thorn
hey bore thee to calvary
     
   
     
   


o come to my heart lord jesus
here is room in my heart for thee

      
     

when the heavens shall ring and the angels sing
at thy coming to victory
let thy voice call me home
saying “yet there is room
here is room at my side for thee”
    
     
     
     



and my heart shall rejoice lord jesus
when thou comest and callest me

      
     


god moves in a mysterious way
his wonders to perform
he plants his footsteps in the sea
and rides upon the storm
    
  
  
   
     

deep in unfathomable mines
of never-failing skill
he treasures up his bright designs
and works his sovereign will
  
   
     
   

ye fearful saints fresh courage take
he clouds ye so much dread
are big with mercy and shall break
in blessings on your head
   
 
   
  

judge not the lord by feeble sense
but trust him for his grace
behind a frowning providence
he hides a smiling face
  
  
  
  

his purposes will ripen fast
unfolding every hour
he bud may have a bitter taste
but sweet will be the flower
  
   
   
    


blind unbelief is sure to err
and scan his work in vain
god is his own interpreter
and he will make it plain
    
    
    
 


o lord you’re beautiful
your face is all i seek
for when your eyes are on this child
your grace abounds to me

o lord please light the fire
hat once burned bright and clear
replace the lamp of my first love
hat burns with holy fear
o lord you’re beautiful


i wanna take your word
and shine it all around
but first help me just to live it lord
and when i’m doing well
help me to never seek a crown
for my reward is giving glory to you



o lord you’re beautiful
your face is all i seek
for when your eyes are on this child
your grace abounds to me


he church’s one foundation
is jesus christ her lord
she is his new creation
by water and the word
   
   
    
  
 

from heav’n he came and sought her
o be his holy bride
with his own blood he bought her
and for her life he died
    
   
  
   

she is from ev’ry nation
yet one o’er all the earth
her charter of salvation
one lord one faith one birth
 
  
  
 

one holy name she blesses
partakes one holy food
and to one hope she presses
with ev’ry grace endued
  
  
  
  

hough with a scornful wonder
men see her sore oppressed
by schisms rent asunder
by heresies distressed
 
 
  
 

yet saints their watch are keeping
heir cry goes up “how long”
and soon the night of weeping
shall be the morn of song
   
   
  
  

’mid toil and tribulation
and tumult of her war
she waits the consummation
of peace forevermore
   
   
  
  

ill with the vision glorious
her longing eyes are blest
and the great church victorious
shall be the church at rest
  
  
  
 

yet she on earth hath union
with god the three in one
and mystic sweet communion
with those whose rest is won
    
    
  
 


with all her sons and daughters
who by the master’s hand
led through the deathly waters
repose in eden land

and myrrh their texture fills
its fragrance reached to this heart of mine
with joy my being thrills

for aloes had a part
and when i think of the cross he bore
my eyes with tear-drops start

only his great eternal love
made my saviour go

with healing in a touch
each time my feet in some sin
have slipped

into a world of woe
only his great eternal love
made my saviour go

o open wide the door
and i shall enter my heav’nly home
o dwell forevermore

filling us with courage and strength
o follow you


you are the stone
hat the builders rejected
a rock of refuge
where my pride is broken

a sure foundation
when the sand is sinking
where we are built upon
like living stones
  you are the stone



here is no one else like you
here is no one like you lord
here is no one else like you
son of man and son of god
son of man and son of god

when from the cross
you to the depths descended
he host of hell conspired
o make you captive

but ev’ry chain of sin
and death you’ve broken
are triumphed over
by your mighty power



here is no one else like you
here is no one like you lord
here is no one else like you
son of man and son of god
son of man and son of god

i want to run
he race you’ve set before me
even to share
in the suff’ring of the cross
hat i might gain
he prize for which you called me
o be with you son of man
and son of god
o be with you son of man
and son of god

hen from the earth
you to the heights ascended
where you are seated
at your father’s right hand

forever pleading
for the souls you’ve captured
forever watching
as you call us home



here is no one else like you
here is no one like you lord
here is no one else like you
son of man and son of god
son of man and son of god
son of man and son of god


brightly beams our father’s mercy
from his lighthouse evermore
but to us he gives the keeping
of the lights along the shore
    
    
  
    
  

let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
for to us he gives the keeping
of the lights along the shore

     
   
  
   

dark the night of sin has settled
loud the angry billows roar
eager eyes are watching longing
for the lights along the shore
    
   
  
    

let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
eager eyes are watching longing
for the lights along the shore

     
   
  
   

rim your feeble lamp my brother
some poor sailor tempest tossed
rying now to make the harbour
in the darkness may be lost
   
   
   
  


let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
rying now to make the harbour
some poor sailor may be lost

forgive our foolish ways
reclothe us in our rightful mind
in purer lives thy service find
in deeper reverence praise
   
   
   
    
   
  

in simple trust like theirs who heard
beside the syrian sea

ake from our souls the strain and stress
and let our ordered lives confess
he beauty of thy peace
  
   
   
    
   

breathe through the heats of our desire
hy coolness and thy balm
let sense be dumb let flesh retire
speak through the earthquake wind
and fire
o still small voice of calm

on the sharp thorny crown
and slaps on thy gaunt cheeks

and the blood from thy forehead
is now trickling down
all the more they are engulfed with
laughter

brightest and best of the sons of the morning
dawn on our darkness and lend us thine aid
star of the east the horizon adorning
guide where our infant redeemer is laid
  
     
    
     
    

cold on his cradle the dewdrops are shining
low lies his head with the beasts of the stall
angels adore him in slumber reclining
maker and monarch and saviour of all
    
    
     
    

say shall we yield him in costly devotion
odours of edom and offerings divine
gems of the mountain and pearls of the ocean
myrrh from the forest or gold from the mine
      
   
   
      

vainly we offer each ample oblation
vainly with gifts would his favour secure
richer by far is the heart’s adoration
dearer to god are the prayers of the poor

here he prayed ’neath the old
olive trees

how vast beyond all measure

how great the pain of searing loss
he father turns his face away
as wounds which mar the chosen one
bring many sons to glory
how deep the father’s love

until it was accomplished
his dying breath has brought me life

no gifts no pow’r no wisdom
but i will boast in jesus christ
his death and resurrection

why should i gain from his reward

lord lift me up and let me stand
by faith on heaven’s tableland
a higher plain than i have found

and catch a gleam of glory bright
but still i’ll pray ’til heaven i’ve found
“lord lead me on to higher ground”

blessd be the fountain of blood
o a world of sinners revealed
blessd be the dear son of god
only by his stripes we are healed
   
    
   
   
   

ho’ i’ve wandered far from his fold
bringing to my heart pain and woe
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow
    
    
  
    

whiter than the snow
whiter than the snow
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow

   
  
    

horny was the crown that he wore
and the cross his body o’ercame
grievous were the sorrows he bore
but he suffered thus not in vain
   
     
   
    

may i to that fountain be led
made to cleanse my sins here below
wash me in the blood that he shed
and i shall be whiter than snow

wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow

often has my heart gone astray
crimson do my sins seem to me
water cannot wash them away
   
    
    
     

jesus to the fountain of thine
leaning on thy promise i go
cleanse me by thy washing divine
and i shall be whiter than snow
     
    
  
    


whiter than the snow
whiter than the snow
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow

gladly forsaking this world for him
  
     
    

   
     

living for jesus though life is brief
facing death’s shadows sorrow and grief
joyous triumphant never despondent
until at last our crowns we receive
     
   

   
     
  


living for jesus conquering sin
bearing the cross ’mid mock’ry and din
life’s journey ended our tent upended
life everlasting we’ll then begin
    
   

     
   
  


free from the law o happy condition
jesus has bled and there is remission
cursed by the law and bruised by the fall
grace hath redeemed us once for all
   
    
     

     
   

once for all o sinner receive it
once for all o brother believe it
cling to the cross the burden will fall
christ hath redeemed us once for all

    
     
      
    
now we are free there’s no
condemnation
jesus provides a perfect salvation
“come unto me” o hear his sweet call
come and he saves us once for all
     
   
     
    

once for all o sinner receive it
once for all o brother believe it
cling to the cross the burden will fall

passing from death to life at his call
blessd salvation once for all
      
     
     
   


once for all o sinner receive it

once in royal david’s city
stood a lowly cattle shed
where a mother laid her baby
in a manger for his bed
mary was that mother mild
jesus christ her little child
once in royal david’s city


he came down to earth from heaven
who is god and lord of all
and his shelter was a stable
and his cradle was a stall
with the poor and meek and lowly
lived on earth our saviour holy


and through all his wondrous childhood
day by day like us he grew
he was little weak and helpless
ears and smiles like us he knew
and he feeleth for our sadness
and he shareth in our gladness


still among the poor and lowly
hope in christ is brought to birth
with the promise of salvation
for the nations of the earth
still in him our life is found
and our hope of heav’n is crowned


and our eyes at last shall see him
hrough his own redeeming love
for that child so dear and gentle
is our lord in heav’n above
and he leads his children on
o the place where he is gone



not in that poor lowly stable
with the oxen standing by
we shall see him but in heaven
set at god’s right hand on high
when like stars his children crowned
all in white shall wait around


rue-hearted whole-hearted faithful and loyal
king of our lives by thy grace we will be
under the standard exalted and royal
strong in thy strength we will battle for thee
 
   
    
    
   

peal out the watchword silence it never
song of our spirits rejoicing and free
peal out the watchword loyal forever
king of our lives by thy grace we will be

   
    
     
     

rue-hearted whole-hearted fullest allegiance
yielding henceforth to our glorious king
valiant endeavour and loving obedience
freely and joyously now would we bring
   
    
    
     

peal out the watchword silence it never
song of our spirits rejoicing and free
peal out the watchword loyal forever
king of our lives by thy grace we will be

   
    
     
     

rue-hearted whole-hearted saviour
all-glorious
ake thy great power and reign there alone
over our wills and affections victorious
freely surrendered and wholly thine own
   
    
    
    


peal out the watchword silence it never
song of our spirits rejoicing and free
peal out the watchword loyal forever
king of our lives by thy grace we will be

   
    
     
     


my faith looks up to thee
hou lamb of calvary
saviour divine
   
   
  
 

now hear me while i pray
ake all my guilt away
oh let me from this day
be wholly thine
  
 
   
  

may thy rich grace impart
strength to my fainting heart
my zeal inspire
  
    
   

as thou hast died for me
oh may my love to thee
pure warm and changeless be
a living fire
    
   
   
 

while life’s dark maze i tread
and griefs around me spread
be thou my guide
   
   
 

bid darkness turn to day
wipe sorrow’s tears away
nor let me ever stray
from thee aside
   
 
   
  

when ends life’s transient dream
when death’s cold sullen stream
shall o’er me roll
   
  
 


blest saviour then in love
fear and distrust remove
oh bear me safe above
a ransomed soul

for no one else in history is like you
and history itself belongs to you

and i will share eternity with you
jesus lover of my soul

and all this is for you
for your glory and your fame

over and around us lies

joy has dawned upon the world
promised from creation
god’s salvation now unfurled
hope for ev’ry nation

not with fanfares from above
not with scenes of glory
but a humble gift of love
jesus born of mary
  joy has dawned

sounds of wonder fill the sky
with the songs of angels
as the mighty prince of life
shelters in a stable

hands that set each star in place
shaped the earth in darkness
cling now to a mother’s breast
vulnerable and helpless

shepherds bow before the lamb
gazing at the glory
gifts of men from distant lands
prophesy the story

gold a king is born today
incense god is with us
myrrh his death will make a way
and by his blood he’ll win us


son of adam son of heav’n
given as a ransom
reconciling god and man
christ our mighty champion

what a saviour what a friend
what a glorious mystery
once a babe in bethlehem
now the lord of history


like a waterfall
is to one drop of rain
like a mountain tow’rs
above a single grain of sand

like the blazing sun
is to a candle flame
like a thousand years to one day

  like a waterfall
beyond sight beyond mind
beyond sense space and time
most beautiful mystery of all


you are god above
angels worship you
most beautiful mystery
hree times holy god
god whose name is love
most beautiful mystery
you stride among the stars
you call them each by name
o you the galaxies
are only dust upon the scales

before the world was formed
not even day or night
and all the angels sang
with pure delight
you were there and we were not
beyond sight beyond mind
beyond sense space and time
most beautiful mystery of all


you are god above
angels worship you
most beautiful mystery
hree times holy god
god whose name is love
most beautiful mystery


you are god my god
you are most beautiful mystery


you are god above
angels worship you

hose ties which naught can sever
for i am his and he is mine

o guard me on my onward course
and bring me safe to heaven

so now to watch to work to war
and then to rest forever
    
   
    
  

i’ve found a friend o such a friend
so kind and true and tender
so wise a counsellor and guide
so mighty a defender

o for a faith that will not shrink
ho’ pressed by ev’ry foe
hat will not tremble on the brink
of any earthly woe
    
    
  
    
   

hat will not murmur nor complain
beneath the chastening rod
but in the hour of grief or pain
will lean upon its god
     
  
  
   

a faith that shines more bright and clear
when tempests rage without
hat when in danger knows no fear
in darkness feels no doubt
   
   
     
  


lord give us such a faith as this
and then whate’er may come
we’ll taste e’en here the hallowed bliss
of an eternal home

nor forsake you
and his word is true

hrough the darkest night
his light will shine
god is good god is good
all the time
we were sinners
so unworthy

it may not be on the mountain’s height
or over the stormy sea
it may not be at the battle’s front
my lord will have need of me
    
     
     
      
   
but if by a still small voice he calls
o paths i do not know
i’ll answer dear lord with my hand
in yours
i’ll go where you want me to go
    
   
    
    

i’ll go where you want me to go dear lord
o’er mountain or plain or sea
i’ll say what you want me to say dear lord
i’ll be what you want me to be

     
   
      
     

perhaps today there are loving words
which jesus would have me speak
here may be now in the paths of sin
some wand’rer whom i should seek
    
   
    
   

o saviour if you will be my guide
hough dark and rugged the way
my voice shall echo the message sweet
i’ll say what you want me to say
    
    
      
     

i’ll go where you want me to go dear lord
o’er mountain or plain or sea
i’ll say what you want me to say dear lord
i’ll be what you want me to be

     
   
      
     

here’s surely somewhere a lowly place
in earth’s harvest fields so wide
where i may labour through life’s short day
for jesus the crucified
    
  
     
  

so trusting my all unto your care
i know you always love me
i’ll do your will with a heart sincere
i’ll be what you want me to be
   
   
     
     


i’ll go where you want me to go dear lord
o’er mountain or plain or sea
i’ll say what you want me to say dear lord
i’ll be what you want me to be

and his wondrous love to me
on the cruel cross he suffered
from the curse to set me free

brightly beams our father’s mercy
from his lighthouse evermore
but to us he gives the keeping
of the lights along the shore
-      
    
   ―
    
 

let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
for to us he gives the keeping
of the lights along the shore

    
   
   
   

dark the night of sin has settled
loud the angry billows roar
eager eyes are watching longing
for the lights along the shore
    
  
  
  

let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
eager eyes are watching longing
for the lights along the shore

    
   
   
   

rim your feeble lamp my brother
some poor sailor tempest tossed
rying now to make the harbour
in the darkness may be lost
    
  
    
’     


let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave

he lives he lives
he triumphed over death
he lives he lives
he lord revealed his strength
   

   
   
   
   

he lives he lives
enthroned above all earthly strife
he leads us to eternal life
   
 
     

he wicked hands of sinners
had nailed him to the tree
our guilt and our transgressions
had caused his agony
  
  
  
  

he sweat like blood was flowing
from his disfigured brow
his task was done
oh praise him now
  
    
    

he lives he lives
he triumphed over death
he lives he lives
he lord revealed his strength

   
   
   
   

he lives he lives
enthroned above all earthly strife
he leads us to eternal life
   
 
     

his body then was taken
by joseph from the cross
in his own tomb he laid it
not counting it a loss
  
    
   
   

but suddenly the sun shone
and darkness took its flight
he lord had said
“let there be light”
   
   
    

he lives he lives
he triumphed over death
he lives he lives
he lord revealed his strength

   
   
   
   

he lives he lives
enthroned above all earthly strife
he leads us to eternal life
   
 
     

at dawn there came with mary
some women to the tomb
an angel stood beside them
and scattered all their gloom
   
   
  
   

“go quickly tell the others
hat he is risen from the dead”
and death forever
lost its dread
  
   
   

he lives he lives
he triumphed over death
he lives he lives
he lord revealed his strength

   
   
   
   

he lives he lives
enthroned above all earthly strife
he leads us to eternal life
   
 
     

as mary stands bewildered
still grieving in her heart
she sees her risen saviour
and can’t contain her start
   
  
   
   

she shouts in exultation
“my master and my lord”
and quickly runs
o spread the word
   
  
    

he lives he lives
he triumphed over death
he lives he lives
he lord revealed his strength

   
   
   
   


he lives he lives
enthroned above all earthly strife
he leads us to eternal life

here were ninety and nine that safely lay
in the shelter of the fold
but one was out on the hills away
far off from the gates of gold
  
   
     
     
     

away on the mountains wild and bare
away from the tender shepherd’s care
away from the tender shepherd’s care
    
     
     
lord thou hast here thy ninety and nine
are they not enough for thee
but the shepherd made answer
“this of mine
has wandered away from me
   
   
      
     

and although the road be rough and steep
i go to the desert to find my sheep
i go to the desert to find my sheep”
       
    
    
but none of the ransomed ever knew
how deep were the waters crossed
nor how dark was the night
hat the lord passed thro’
ere he found his sheep that was lost
     
     
       
    

out in the desert he heard its cry
sick and helpless and ready to die
sick and helpless and ready to die
    
      
      
lord whence are those blood drops
all the way
hat mark out the mountain’s track
hey were shed for one who had gone
astray
ere the shepherd could bring him back

    
    
     
    

lord whence are thy hands so rent
and torn
hey’re pierced tonight by many a thorn
hey’re pierced tonight by many a thorn
     
     
     
but all thro’ the mountains thunder riv’n
and up from the rocky steep
here arose a glad cry to the gate
of heav’n
“rejoice i have found my sheep”
    
     
      
   


and the angels echoed around the throne
“rejoice for the lord brings back his own
rejoice for the lord brings back his own”
     
   
   


jesus my lord to thee i cry
unless thou help me i must die
oh bring thy free salvation nigh

but yet for me thy blood was spilt
and thou canst make me what thou wilt
and take me as i am
    
    
   
   

and take me as i am

i heard the voice of jesus say
“come unto me and rest
lay down thou weary one lay down
hy head upon my breast”
   
   
    
    
  

i came to jesus as i was
weary and worn and sad
i found in him a resting place
and he has made me glad
    
   
     
   

i heard the voice of jesus say
“behold i freely give
he living water thirsty one
stoop down and drink and live”
   
  
   
  

i came to jesus and i drank
of that life-giving stream
my thirst was quenched my soul revived
and now i live in him
     
  
     
   

i heard the voice of jesus say
“i am this dark world’s light
look unto me thy morn shall rise
and all thy day be bright”
   
     
    
   


i looked to jesus and i found
in him my star my sun
and in that light of life i’ll walk
ill travelling days are done

wondrous sov’reign of the sea
jesus saviour pilot me
   
   
   
 
  
    

when at last i near the shore
and the fearful breakers roar
’twixt me and the peaceful rest
hen while leaning on thy breast
may i hear thee say to me
“fear not i will pilot thee”
     
   
   
    
   
    


have your sins been washed in the flow
from the cross on dark calvary
and the one who died do you know
hat from sin you might ransomed be
    
    
    
    
    

hough like scarlet your sins may be
heavy though the weight of your woe
his blood can make you free from sin
it can make them whiter than snow

     
   
   
    

on the cross forsaken was he
from the cross his blood trickled down
hat mankind from sin could be free
for the cross exchanged he his crown
  
   
    
   

hough like scarlet your sins may be
heavy though the weight of your woe
his blood can make you free from sin
it can make them whiter than snow

     
   
   
    

jesus called and i did reply
“come to me” he saidi did go
what i was no longer am i

hough like scarlet your sins may be
heavy though the weight of your woe
his blood can make you free from sin
it can make them whiter than snow

     
   
   
    

like the wayward lamb i had strayed
“pastures green” were silver and gold
on the cross atonement was made
jesus brought me back to the fold
    
   
    
     

hough like scarlet your sins may be
heavy though the weight of your woe
his blood can make you free from sin
it can make them whiter than snow

     
   
   
    

contemplating i love to see
from the cross the life-giving flow
o us bringing grace full and free
by it making us white as snow
   
   
     
    


hough like scarlet your sins may be

his blood can make you free from sin

on a hill far away
stood an old rugged cross
he emblem of suffering and shame
and i love that old cross
where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain
    

      
    
       
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
ill my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

   
    
    
    

oh that old rugged cross
so despised by the world
has a wondrous attraction for me
for the dear lamb of god left his glory above
o bear it to dark calvary
     

      
        
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
ill my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

   
    
    
    
in that old rugged cross
stained with blood so divine
a wondrous beauty i see
for ’twas on that old cross
jesus suffered and died
o pardon and sanctify me
     
 
     
     
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
ill my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

   
    
    
    

o the old rugged cross i will ever be true
it’s shame and reproach gladly bear
hen he’ll call me some day
o my home far away
where his glory forever i’ll share
     

     
      
     


so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
ill my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

should stoop to love
he peoples of the earth
or why as shepherd
he should seek the wand’rer
with his mysterious
promise of new birth
i cannot tell

hat he was born of mary
when bethl’em’s manger
was his only home
and that he lived
at nazareth and laboured
and so the saviour
saviour of the world is come

i cannot tell
how silently he suffered
as with his peace
he graced this place of tears
or how his heart
upon the cross was broken
he crown of pain
o three and thirty years

but this i know
he heals the broken-hearted
and stays our sin
and calms our lurking fear
and lifts the burden
from the heavy laden
for yet the saviour
saviour of the world is here

i cannot tell
how he will win the nations
how he will claim
his earthly heritage
how satisfy the needs
and aspirations
of east and west
of sinner and of sage

but this i know
all flesh shall see his glory
and he shall reap
he harvest he has sown
and some glad day
his sun shall shine in splendour
when he the saviour
saviour of the world is known

i cannot tell
how all the lands shall worship
when at his bidding
ev’ry storm is stilled
or who can say
how great the jubilation
when ev’ry heart
with perfect love is filled


but this i know
he skies will thrill with rapture
and myriad myriad
human voices sing
and earth to heav’n
and heav’n to earth will answer
“at last the saviour
saviour of the world is king”


take me past the outer courts
and through the holy place
past the brazen altar
lord i want to see your face

pass me by the crowds of people
and the priests who sing their praise
i hunger and thirst for your righteousness
but it’s only found one place
  take me past the outer courts



so take me in to the holy of holies
ake me in by the blood of the lamb
so take me in to the holy of holies
ake the coal cleanse my lips
here i am

when jesus i knew not i did not know life
i spent all my days in contention and strife
hen i heard a voice which all trouble surmounts
“he loves you he loves you”

when the people rose to sing of
jesus christ the risen one

when the lost began to sing of

you’re moving
a mighty river through the nations
and young and old will turn to jesus

fling wide you heavenly gates
prepare the way of the risen lord


open up the doors and
let the music play
let the streets resound with singing
songs that bring your hope
songs that bring your joy
dancers who dance upon injustice



do you feel the darkness tremble
when all the saints join in one song
and all the streams flow as one river
o wash away our brokenness



and we can see that god
you’re moving
a time of jubilee is coming
when young and old will turn to jesus

fling wide you heavenly gates
prepare the way of the risen lord



open up the doors and
let the music play
let the streets resound with singing
songs that bring your hope
songs that bring your joy
dancers who dance upon injustice


up calvary’s mountain one dreadful morn
walked christ my saviour weary and worn
facing for sinners death on the cross
hat he might save them from endless loss
  
   
     
    
     

blessd redeemer precious redeemer
seems now i see him on calvary’s tree
wounded and bleeding for sinners pleading
blind and unheedingdying for me

   
     
    
     

“father forgive them” thus did he pray
e’en while his lifeblood flowed fast away
praying for sinners while in such woe
no one but jesus ever loved so
     
     
    
     

blessd redeemer precious redeemer
seems now i see him on calvary’s tree
wounded and bleeding for sinners pleading
blind and unheedingdying for me

   
     
    
     

o how i love him saviour and friend
how can my praises ever find end
hrough years unnumbered on heaven’s
shore
my tongue shall praise him forevermore
     
     
      
     


blessd redeemer precious redeemer
seems now i see him on calvary’s tree
wounded and bleeding for sinners pleading
blind and unheedingdying for me

all the burdens of my heart rolled away
rolled away rolled away rolled away
all the burdens of my heart rolled away

all my sins he forgave
by the blood of the lamb
rolled away rolled away rolled away
all the burdens of my heart rolled away
   
   
     
     


in the silent midnight watches
standing at your door
calls the saviour pleading knocking
now as oft before
   
   
   
   
  

he would enter with salvation
heart oppressed by sin
open now the door for jesus
let him enter in
  
  
   
  

death will come some day relentless
come to every man
none can heedlessly ignore him
none his entry ban
   
  
    
   

jesus waits in mercy pleading
at the door today
him not death the cruel reaper
you can turn away
   
  
   
  

when you hear the saviour knocking
calling at your door
o receive him let him enter
and your soul restore
   
   
   
  

hen when breaks the golden morning
bright eternal fair
he will open heaven’s portals
and receive you there

must i empty handed go

    
   
    
 

o ye saints arouse be earnest
up and work while yet ’tis day
ere the night of death o’ertake thee
strive for souls while still you may
   
   
    
   


“must i go and empty handed”
must i meet my saviour so
not one soul with which to greet him
must i empty handed go

    
   
    
 


loved with everlasting love
led by grace that love to know
spirit breathing from above
hou hast taught me it is so
  
  
  
    
  
o this full and perfect peace
from his presence all divine

in a love which cannot cease
i am his and he is mine   
   
  

    
     
heav’n above is softer blue
earth around is sweeter green
something lives in every hue
christless eyes have never seen
   
   
   
   
birds with gladder songs o’erflow
flow’rs with deeper beauties shine

since i know as i now know
i am his and he is mine   
  
    

   
     
hings that once were wild alarms
cannot now disturb my rest
closed in everlasting arms
pillowed on the loving breast
   
   
    
     
o to lie forever here
doubt and care and self resign

while he whispers in my ear
i am his and he is mine   
    
   

    
     
his forever only his
who the lord and me shall part
ah with what a rest of bliss
christ can fill the loving heart
   
   
     
    

heav’n and earth may fade and flee
first-born light in gloom decline

but while god and i shall be
i am his and he is mine   
   
    

    
     


deeper than the deepest of the oceans
everlasting deep beyond compare
higher than the highest lights of heaven
is the love that christ with us does share
    
    
  
     
  

he has cleansed me from sin’s blight
and given me robes of pure white
and his holy spirit gave to me
i now am in his family

   
   
   
   

dark and fearful striking me with terror
were the years that i had spent in sin
i was lost unfortunate and hopeless
jesus found me and he took me in
   
     
   
     

he has cleansed me from sin’s blight
and given me robes of pure white
and his holy spirit gave to me
i now am in his family

   
   
   
   

praise the lord for by the grace of jesus
i am saved from sin and death set free
over me sin has no more dominion
jesus christ my saviour dwells in me
   
     
    
     


he has cleansed me from sin’s blight
and given me robes of pure white
and his holy spirit gave to me
i now am in his family

when the storms of life are raging
empests wild on sea and land
i will seek a place of refuge
in the shadow of god’s hand
    
    
  
   
  

he will hide me he will hide me
where no harm can e’er betide me
he will hide me safely hide me
in the shadow of his hand

   
   
  
   

enemies may strive to injure
satan all his arts employ
he will turn what seems to harm me
into everlasting joy
   
  
   
    

he will hide me he will hide me
where no harm can e’er betide me
he will hide me safely hide me
in the shadow of his hand

   
   
  
   

ho’ he may send some affliction
’twill but make me long for home
for in love and not in anger
all his chastenings will come
    
    
   
   

he will hide me he will hide me
where no harm can e’er betide me
he will hide me safely hide me
in the shadow of his hand

   
   
  
   

so while here the cross i’m bearing
meeting storms and billows wild
jesus for my soul is caring
naught can harm his father’s child
    
   
    
    


he will hide me he will hide me
where no harm can e’er betide me
he will hide me safely hide me
in the shadow of his hand

   
   
  
   

sweet hour of prayer
sweet hour of prayer
hat calls me from a world of care
and bids me at my father’s throne
make all my wants and wishes known
 
   
   
   
  
in seasons of distress and grief
my soul has often found relief
and oft escaped the tempter’s snare
by thy return sweet hour of prayer
    
   
    
    
sweet hour of prayer
sweet hour of prayer
hy wings shall my petition bear
o him whose truth and faithfulness
engage the waiting soul to bless
   
    
     
   
and since he bids me seek his face
believe his word and trust his grace
i’ll cast on him my ev’ry care
and wait for thee sweet hour of prayer
   
    
   
    
sweet hour of prayer
sweet hour of prayer
may i thy consolation share
’til from mount pisgah’s lofty height
i view my home and take my flight
   
    
   
    

his robe of flesh i’ll drop and rise
o seize the everlasting prize
and shout while passing through the air
farewell farewell sweet hour of prayer
   
     
    
   


i can hear my saviour calling
i can hear my saviour calling
i can hear my saviour calling
“take thy cross and follow follow me”

children of the heavenly father
safely in his bosom gather
nestling bird nor star in heaven
such a refuge e’er was given
    
    
   
     
   

god his own doth tend and nourish
in his holy courts they flourish
from all evil things he spares them
in his mighty arms he bears them
   
  
  
    

neither life nor death shall ever
from the lord his children sever
unto them his grace he showeth
and their sorrows all he knoweth
     
   
    
   

praise the lord in joyful numbers
your protector never slumbers
at the will of your defender
ev’ry foeman must surrender
   
   
    
  


hough he giveth or he taketh
god his children ne’er forsaketh
his the loving purpose solely
o preserve them pure and holy

lead kindly light amid th’ encircling
gloom lead thou me on
he night is dark and i am far from
home lead thou me on
  
     
  
     
 

keep thou my feet
i do not ask to see
he distant scene
one step enough for me
  
  
 
    

i was not ever thus nor prayed
hat thou shouldst lead me on
i loved to choose and see my path
but now lead thou me on
      
 
      
 

i loved the garish day
and spite of fears
pride ruled my will
remember not past years
 
    
 
  

so long thy power hath blest me
sure it still will lead me on
o’er moor and fen o’er crag and torrent
ill the night is gone
      
 
     
  


and with the morn
hose angel-faces smile
which i have loved
long since and lost awhile
  
  
 
  


on the shore of jordan’s river
in expectation we all stand
here by faith we see the shimmer
of our new and promised land
   
   
   
   
   

let us live in expectation
of that moment when the lord
will receive us into his kingdom
as he promised in his word

   
   
    
   

like the sun in radiant glory
glows the new jerusalem
songs of praises tell the story
of that precious priceless gem
    
  
   
  

let us live in expectation
of that moment when the lord
will receive us into his kingdom
as he promised in his word

   
   
    
   

many saints their race have finished
crossed the jordan with a prayer
and we too shall cross that river
very soon we’ll all be there
   
   
   
    

let us live in expectation
of that moment when the lord
will receive us into his kingdom
as he promised in his word

   
   
    
   

shades of death engulf the river
but beyond its deathly throes
lies the kingdom of the blessed
and the end of all our woes
   
   
  
    


let us live in expectation
of that moment when the lord
will receive us into his kingdom
as he promised in his word

am i a soldier of the cross
a follower of the lamb
and shall i fear to own his cause
or blush to speak his name
     
     
   
     
   

must i be carried to the skies
on flowery beds of ease
while others fought to win the prize
and sailed through bloody seas
    
    
     
    

are there no foes for me to face
must i not stem the flood
is this vile world a friend to grace
o help me on to god
    
     
   
   


sure i must fight if i would reign
increase my courage lord
i’ll bear the toil endure the pain
supported by thy word
    
    
      
      


each me lord how to pray in contrition
and your holy commands to fulfil
free my heart from its pride and ambition
may it always conform to your will
may it always conform to your will
   
   
   
   
    
    

may you reign in my heart without measure
and your spirit my spirit control
may in you i find all of my pleasure
and your name in my heart thus extol
and your name in my heart thus extol
     
     
    
    
    


cleansed within by the blood of my saviour
may my heart be kept free from all sin
may it find its delight and its favour
as it loves both my foes and my kin
as it loves both my foes and my kin

work through the morning hours
work while the dew is sparkling
work ’mid springing flowers

something to keep in store

when man works no more
    
  
   
  

work for the night is coming
under the sunset skies
while their bright tints are glowing
work for daylight flies
  
   
   
 

work till the last beam fadeth
fadeth to shine no more
work while the night is darkening
when man’s work is o’er

we’ll join the everlasting song
and crown him lord of all
    
   

   
 



for god so loved the world
he gave his only son
to die on calvary’s tree
from sin to set me free
some day he’s coming back
what glory that will be
wonderful his love to me

am i a soldier of the cross
a follower of the lamb
and shall i fear to own his cause
or blush to speak his name
     



     
   
    
   

  
   
    
    
  
   
  

   
   
  
   
  

must i be carried to the skies
on flowery beds of ease
while others fought to win the prize
and sailed through bloody seas



    
   
    
   

  
   
    
    
  
   
  

   
   
  
   
  

are there no foes for me to face
must i not stem the flood
is this vile world a friend to grace
o help me on to god



     
    
    
  

  
   
    
    
  
   
  

   
   
  
   
  

sure i must fight if i would reign
increase my courage lord
i’ll bear the toil endure the pain
supported by thy word



     
    
   
    

  
   
    
    
  
   
  


   
   
  
   
  



through our god we shall do valiantly
it is he who will tread down our enemies
we’ll sing and shout his victory
christ is king christ is king christ is king

for god has won the victory
and set his people free
his word has slain the enemy
the earth shall stand and see that
repeat from start   
  through our god

rock of ages cleft for me
let me hide myself in thee
let the water and the blood
from thy wounded side which flowed
be of sin the double cure
save from wrath and make me pure
 
 
  
   
     
   
   
not the labour of my hands
can fulfil thy law’s demands
could my zeal no respite know
could my tears forever flow
all for sin could not atone
hou must save and thou alone
    
    
  
   
    
    
nothing in my hand i bring
simply to the cross i cling
naked come to thee for dress
helpless look to thee for grace
foul i to the fountain fly
wash me saviour or i die
     
     
     
    
    
    

while i draw this fleeting breath
when my eyes shall close in death
while i rise to worlds unknown
and behold thee on thy throne
rock of ages cleft for me
let me hide myself in thee

outside a city wall
where the dear lord was crucified
who died to save us all
   
    
  
     
   

o dearly dearly has he loved
and we must love him too
and trust in his redeeming blood
and try his works to do

what pains he had to bear
but we believe it was for us
he hung and suffered there

and we must love him too
and trust in his redeeming blood
and try his works to do

saved by his precious blood

and we must love him too
and trust in his redeeming blood
and try his works to do

of heaven and let us in

and we must love him too
and trust in his redeeming blood
and try his works to do

’twas grace that taught my heart to fear
and grace my fears relieved
how precious did that grace appear
he hour i first believed
   
   
     
   

hro’ many dangers toils and snares
i have already come
’tis grace that brought me safe thus far
and grace will lead me home
    
   
     
  

he earth shall soon dissolve like snow
he sun forbear to shine
but god who called me here below
shall be forever mine
   
    
       
   

yea when this flesh and heart shall fail
and mortal life shall cease
i shall possess within the veil
a life of joy and peace
    
  
    
   

when we’ve been there
en thousand years

we’ve no less days to sing god’s praise
han when we first begun
   
  
    
    

in tenderness he sought me
weary and sick with sin
and on his shoulders brought me
back to his fold again
while angels in his presence sang
until the courts of heaven rang
   
 
  
   
   
    
    

oh the love that sought me
oh the blood that bought me
oh the grace that brought me to the fold
wondrous grace that brought me to the fold

  
  
  
  
he washed the bleeding sin wounds
and poured in oil and wine
he whispered to assure me
“i’ve found thee thou art mine”
i never heard a sweeter voice
it made my aching heart rejoice
  
   
  
    
   
   

oh the love that sought me
oh the blood that bought me
oh the grace that brought me to the fold
wondrous grace that brought me to the fold

  
  
  
  
he pointed to the nail prints
for me his blood was shed
a mocking crown so thorny
was placed upon his head
i wondered what he saw in me
o suffer such deep agony
   
   
 
  
    
     

oh the love that sought me
oh the blood that bought me
oh the grace that brought me to the fold

he brightest and the best
when he will call us to his side
o be with him his spotless bride
   
   
 
   
    
    


oh the love that sought me
oh the blood that bought me
oh the grace that brought me to the fold
wondrous grace that brought me to the fold

o where are the reapers that garner in
the sheaves of the good from the fields of sin
with sickles of truth must the work be done
and no one may rest till the “harvest home”
   
      
      
    
     

where are the reapers o who will come
and share in the glory of the “harvest home”
o who will help us to garner in
the sheaves of good from the fields of sin

      
     
      
    

go out in the byways and search them all
the wheat may be there but the weeds are tall
then search in the highway and pass none by
but gather them all for the home on high
   
    
     
    

where are the reapers o who will come
and share in the glory of the “harvest home”
o who will help us to garner in
the sheaves of good from the fields of sin

      
     
      
    

the fields are all ripening and far and wide
the world now is waiting the harvest tide
but reapers are few and the work is great
and much will be lost should the harvest wait
      
     
    
     

where are the reapers o who will come
and share in the glory of the “harvest home”
o who will help us to garner in
the sheaves of good from the fields of sin

      
     
      
    

so come with your sickles ye sons of men
and gather together the golden grain
toil on till the lord of the harvest come
then share ye his joy in the “harvest home”
    
    
   -

amazing grace how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me
i once was lost but now am found
was blind but now i see

’twas grace that taught my heart to fear
and grace my fears relieved
how precious did that grace appear
the hour i first believed
  amazing grace



my chains are gone i’ve been set free
my god my saviour has ransomed me
and like a flood his mercy reigns
unending love amazing grace



the lord has promised good to me
his word my hope secures
he will my shield and portion be
as long as life endures



my chains are gone i’ve been set free
my god my saviour has ransomed me
and like a flood his mercy reigns
unending love amazing grace





the earth shall soon dissolve like snow
the sun forbear to shine
but god who called me here below
will be forever mine


one day when heaven was filled with his praises
one day when sin was as black as could be
jesus came forth to be born of a virgin
dwelt among men my example is he
  

    
     
     
     

living he loved me dying he saved me
buried he carried my sins far away
rising he justified freely forever
one day he’s comingo glorious day

      
     
   
  
     

one day they led him up calvary’s mountain
one day they nailed him to die on the tree
suffering anguish despised and rejected
bearing our sins my redeemer is he

    
    
      
     

living he loved me dying he saved me
buried he carried my sins far away
rising he justified freely forever
one day he’s comingo glorious day

      
     
   
  
     

one day they left him alone in the garden
one day he rested from suffering free
angels came down o’er his tomb to keep vigil
hope of the hopeless my saviour is he

     
    
      
    

living he loved me dying he saved me
buried he carried my sins far away
rising he justified freely forever
one day he’s comingo glorious day

      
     
   
  
     

one day the grave could conceal him no longer
one day the stone rolled away from the door
then he arose over death he had conquered
now is ascended my lord evermore

   
   
    
    

living he loved me dying he saved me
buried he carried my sins far away
rising he justified freely forever
one day he’s comingo glorious day

      
     
   
  
     

one day the trumpet will sound for his coming
one day the skies with his glory will shine
wonderful day my beloved ones bringing
glorious saviour this jesus is mine

   
     
    
     


living he loved me dying he saved me
buried he carried my sins far away
rising he justified freely forever

instil a peace and trust within my soul
amid life’s tempest stay thou o’er beside me
bring me at last to my heavenly goal

’tis the grandest theme through the ages rung
’tis the grandest theme for a mortal tongue

’tis the grandest theme let the tidings roll
to the guilty heart to the sinful soul
look to god in faith he will make thee whole
“our god is able to deliver thee”
    
      
    
       


he is able to deliver thee
he is able to deliver thee
though by sin oppressed go to him for rest
“our god is able to deliver thee”

     
     
      
       


great god we sing your mighty hand
by which supported still we stand
the opening year your mercy shows
that mercy crowns it ’til its close
   
   
     
    
    

by day by night at home abroad
still are we guarded by our god
by his incessant bounty fed
by his unerring counsel led
     
   
    
    

with grateful hearts the past we own
the future all to us unknown
we to thy guardian care commit
and peaceful leave before thy feet
  
      
    
   


in scenes exalted or depressed
you are our joy and you our rest
your goodness all our hopes shall raise
adored through all our changing days
      
     
    
     


i stand amazed in the presence
of jesus the nazarene
and wonder how he could love me
a sinner condemned unclean


o how marvellous o how wonderful
and my song shall ever be
o how marvellous o how wonderful
is my saviour’s love for me
i stand amazed
for me it was in the garden
he prayed “not my will but thine”
he had no tears for his own griefs
but sweat drops of blood for mine


o how marvellous o how wonderful
and my song shall ever be
o how marvellous o how wonderful
is my saviour’s love for me
in pity angels beheld him
and came from the world of light
to comfort him in the sorrows
he bore for my soul that night


o how marvellous o how wonderful
and my song shall ever be
o how marvellous o how wonderful
is my saviour’s love for me
he took my sins and my sorrows
he made them his very own
he bore the burden to calvary
and suffered and died alone


o how marvellous o how wonderful
and my song shall ever be
o how marvellous o how wonderful
is my saviour’s love for me

when with the ransomed in glory
his face i at last shall see
’twill be my joy through the ages
to sing of his love for me


o how marvellous o how wonderful
and my song shall ever be
o how marvellous o how wonderful
is my saviour’s love for me


beneath the cross of jesus
i fain would take my stand
the shadow of a mighty rock
within a weary land
  
  
  
    
   

a home within the wilderness
a rest upon the way
from the burning of the noontide heat
and the burden of the day
   
  
   
   

o safe and happy shelter
o refuge tried and sweet
o trysting place where heaven’s love
and heaven’s justice meet
  
 
     
  

as to the holy patriarch
that wondrous dream was given
so seems my saviour’s cross to me
a ladder up to heaven
    
  
    
    

upon the cross of jesus
mine eyes at times can see
the very dying form of one
who suffered there for me
   
    
  
   

and from my stricken heart with tears
two wonders i confess
the wonders of redeeming love
and my unworthiness
   
  
  
  

i take o cross thy shadow
for my abiding place
i ask no other sunshine than
the sunshine of his face
   
  
     
   


content to let the world go by
to know no gain nor loss
my sinful self my only shame
my glory all the cross
   
   
   
  


make me a captive lord
and then i shall be free
force me to render up my sword
and i shall conqueror be
   
   
     
 
  

i sink in life’s alarms
when by myself i stand
imprison me within thine arms
and strong shall be my hand
  
   
   
   

my heart is weak and poor
until its master find
it has no spring of action sure
it varies with the wind
  
  
      
  

it cannot freely move
till thou hast wrought its chain
enslave it with thy matchless love
and deathless it shall reign
   
   
   
  

my power is faint and low
till i have learned to serve
it wants the needed fire to glow
it wants the breeze to nerve
   
    
    
   

it cannot drive the world
until itself be driv’n
its flag can only be unfurled
when thou shalt breathe from heav’n
   
   
   
 

my will is not my own
till thou hast made it thine
if it would reach a monarch’s throne
it must its crown resign
   
  
     
  


it only stands unbent
amid the clashing strife
when on thy bosom it has leant
and found in thee its life
  
   
    
    


o think of the home over there
by the side of the river of light
where the saints all immortal and fair
are robed in their garments of light
-     
   
     
    
  

over there over there
o think of the home over there
over there over there
o think of the home over there

   
   
   
   

my saviour is now over there
there my kindred and friends are at rest
then away from my sorrow and care
let me fly to the land of the blest
    
    
    
    

over there over there
o think of the home over there
over there over there
o think of the home over there

   
   
   
   

i’ll soon be at home over there
for the end of my journey i see
many dear to my heart over there
are watching and waiting for me
    
   
     
    


over there over there
o think of the home over there
over there over there
o think of the home over there

all his ransomed home to bring
then anew this song we’ll sing

when you said that it is done

and when the earth fades
falls from my eyes
and you stand before me
i know you love me
i know you love me


at the cross i bow my knee
where your blood was shed for me
there’s no greater love than this
you have overcome the grave
your glory fills the highest place
what can separate me now

in his arms he’ll take and shield thee

in the cross of christ i glory
tow’ring o’er the wrecks of time
all the light of sacred story
gathers round its head sublime
  
   
   
    
  

when the woes of life o’ertake me
hopes deceive and fears annoy
never shall the cross forsake me
lo it glows with peace and joy
   
     
   
    

when the sun of bliss is beaming
light and love upon my way
from the cross the radiance streaming
adds more lustre to the day
   
    
   
  


bane and blessing pain and pleasure
by the cross are sanctified
peace is there that knows no measure
joys that thro’ all time abide
     
  
   
   


i feel like singing all the time
my tears are wiped away
for jesus is a friend of mine
i’ll serve him every day
     
     
   
     
     

i’m singing singing
singing all the time
singing singing
singing all the time

nailed there by sins of mine
fast fell the burning tears but now
i’m singing all the time
     
   
   
   

i’m singing singing
singing all the time
singing singing
singing all the time

    
    

when fierce temptations try my heart
i sing jesus is mine
and so though tears at times may start
i’m singing all the time
   
   
   
   

i’m singing singing
singing all the time
singing singing
singing all the time

    
    

the wondrous story of the lamb
tell with that voice of thine
till others with the glad new song
go singing all the time
   
  
   
    


i’m singing singing
singing all the time
singing singing
singing all the time

there’s a dear and precious book
though it’s worn and faded now
which recalls those happy days of long ago
when i stood at mother’s knee
with her hand upon my brow
and i heard her voice in gentle tones and low

as he blessed the children dear
how he suffered bled and died upon the tree
of his heavy load of care
then she dried my flowing tears
with her kisses as she said it was for me

but their memory lingers still

as my mother taught me then
and ever in my heart his words abide

light after darkness gain after loss
strength after weakness crown after cross
sweet after bitter hope after fears
home after wandering praise after tears
  
     
     
      
    

sheaves after sowing sun after rain
sight after mystery peace after pain
joy after sorrow calm after blast
rest after weariness sweet rest at last
     
     
      
    


near after distant gleam after gloom
love after loneliness life after tomb
after long agony rapture of bliss
right was the pathway leading to this
    
    
     
    


whom have i lord in heaven but thee
none but thee none but thee
and this my song through life shall be
christ for me christ for me
     
     
   
     
   

he hath for me the wine-press trod
he hath redeemed me “by his blood”
and reconciled my soul to god
christ for me christ for me
     
   
     
   

 i envy not the rich their joys
christ for me christ for me
i covet not earth’s glittering toys
christ for me christ for me
     
   
     
   

earth can no lasting bliss bestow
“fading” is stamped on all below
mine is a joy no end can know
christ for me christ for me
    
     
     
   

though with the poor be cast my lot
christ for me christ for me
“he knoweth best”i murmur not
christ for me christ for me
      
   
       
   

though “vine” and “fig-tree” blight assail
the “labour of the olive fail”
and death o’er flock and herd prevail
christ for me christ for me
    
    
     
   

though i am now on hostile ground
christ for me christ for me
and sin beset me all around
christ for me christ for me
     
   
    
   

let earth her fiercest battles wage
and foes against my soul engage
strong in his strength i scorn their rage
christ for me christ for me
    
    
        
   

and when my life draws to its close
christ for me christ for me
safe in his arms i shall repose
christ for me christ for me
      
   
     
   


when sharpest pains my frame pervade
and the powers of nature fade
still will i sing through death’s cold shade
christ for me christ for me

jesus keep me near the cross
there a precious fountain
free to all a healing stream
flows from calvary’s mountain
   
   
 
   
   

in the cross in the cross
be my glory ever
’til my raptured soul shall find
rest beyond the river

   
   
  
  

near the cross a trembling soul
love and mercy found me
there the bright and morning star
shed its beams around me
   
  
   
  

in the cross in the cross
be my glory ever
’til my raptured soul shall find
rest beyond the river

   
   
  
  

near the cross o lamb of god
bring its scenes before me
help me walk from day to day
with its shadows o’er me
   
  
    
  

in the cross in the cross
be my glory ever
’til my raptured soul shall find
rest beyond the river

   
   
  
  

near the cross i’ll watch and wait
hoping trusting ever
’til i reach the golden strand
just beyond the river
    
   
   
  


in the cross in the cross
be my glory ever
’til my raptured soul shall find
rest beyond the river

not now but in the coming years
it may be in the better land
we’ll read the meaning of our tears
and there some time we’ll understand
-    
-    
      
  
  

then trust in god through all the days
fear not for he doth hold thy hand
though dark thy way still sing and praise
some time some time we’ll understand

  
    
    
      

we’ll catch the broken thread again
and finish what we here began
heav’n will the mysteries explain
and then ah then we’ll understand
  
  
   
    

then trust in god through all the days
fear not for he doth hold thy hand
though dark thy way still sing and praise
some time some time we’ll understand

  
    
    
      

we’ll know why clouds instead of sun
were over many a cherished plan
why song has ceased when scarce begun
’tis there some time we’ll understand
   
     
    
    

then trust in god through all the days
fear not for he doth hold thy hand
though dark thy way still sing and praise
some time some time we’ll understand

  
    
    
      

god knows the way he holds the key
he guides us with unerring hand
some time with tearless eyes we’ll see
yes there up there we’ll understand
     
     
     
      


then trust in god through all the days
fear not for he doth hold thy hand
though dark thy way still sing and praise
some time some time we’ll understand

  
    
    
      


while shepherds watched their flocks
by night
all seated on the ground
the angel of the lord came down
and glory shone around

“fear not” said he for mighty dread
had seized their troubled mind
“glad tidings of great joy i bring
to you and all mankind
  while shepherds watched

“to you in david’s town this day
is born of david’s line
a saviour who is christ the lord
and this shall be the sign

“the heav’nly babe you there shall find
to human view displayed
all meanly wrapped in swathing bands
and in a manger laid”


thus spake the seraph and forthwith
appeared a shining throng
of angels praising god who thus
addressed their joyful song

“all glory be to god on high
and to the earth be peace
goodwill henceforth from heav’n to earth
begin and never cease”



ascribe greatness
to our god the rock
his work is perfect
and all his ways are just

a god of faithfulness and
without injustice
good and upright is he
  ascribe greatness



i love you lord
and i lift my voice
to worship you
o my soul rejoice

take joy my king
in what you hear
may it be a sweet
sweet sound in your ear
i love you lord


’tis the hallowed hour of prayer
and we trustingly bring
all our doubting and our fears
to our saviour and king
   
   
  
     
   

for we know that he delights
a glad welcome to give
and the blessings that we ask for
we shall fully receive

thy darkness passed away
because that light hath on thee shone
in which is perfect day

no fearful shade shall wear
glory shall chase away its gloom
for christ has conquered there

a path though thorny bright
for god by grace shall dwell in thee
and god himself is light

drawn from emmanuel’s veins

and you rose again on high
and you opened the way
for the world to live again
hallelujah for all you’ve done

hallelujah for all you’ve done
hallelujah for all you’ve done

o love that wilt not let me go
i rest my weary soul in thee
i give thee back the life i owe
that in thine ocean depths its flow
may richer fuller be
   
   
     
   
   
  
o light that follow’st all my way
i yield my flick’ring torch to thee
my heart restores its borrowed ray
that in thy sunshine’s blaze its day
may brighter fairer be
     
   
     
   
   
o joy that seekest me through pain
i cannot close my heart to thee
i trace the rainbow through the rain
and feel the promise is not vain
that morn shall tearless be
     
    
      
     
    

o cross that liftest up my head
i dare not ask to fly from thee
i lay in dust life’s glory dead
and from the ground there blossoms red
life that shall endless be

hark the voice of jesus calling
“who will go and work today
fields are ripe and harvests waiting
who will bear the sheaves away”
   
   
  
    
    

long and loud the master calls us
rich reward he offers free
who will answer gladly saying
“here am i send me send me”
  
   
   
   

if you cannot cross the ocean
and the distant lands explore
you can find the lost around you
you can help them at your door
  
   
      
  

if you cannot give your thousands
you can give the widow’s mite
what you truly give for jesus
will be precious in his sight
   
  
   
   

if you cannot speak like angels
if you cannot preach like paul
you can tell the love of jesus
you can say he died for all
  
   
   
    

if you cannot rouse the wicked
with the judgement’s dread alarms
you can lead the little children
to the saviour’s waiting arms
   
     
   
   

let none hear you idly saying
“there is nothing i can do”
while the lost of earth are dying
and the master calls for you
    
  
     
  


take the task he gives you gladly
let his work your pleasure be
answer quickly when he calls you
“here am i send me send me”

i’ll be there

  
  
  
     

on that bright and cloudless morning
when the dead in christ shall rise
and the glory of his resurrection share

   
   
    

when the chosen ones shall gather
to their home beyond the skies
and the roll is called up yonder
i’ll be there

   
  
      

when the roll is called up yonder
when the roll is called up yonder
i’ll be there

  
  
  
     

let us labour for the master
from the dawn ’til setting sun
let us talk of all his wondrous
love and care

    
  
      

and when all of life is over
and our work on earth is done
and the roll is called up yonder
i’ll be there

    
  
     


when the roll is called up yonder
when the roll is called up yonder
i’ll be there

  
  
  
     

the glory of our god in zion
the mortal tongue cannot relate
the universe he keeps his eye on
on earth and sea in space he is great
we sing thy praises lord and creator
ever the samethere is none greater
     
     
   
     
    
    
     
jesus thy son for our sins given
revealed thee lord for us to see
on harps and psalteries toward heaven
we lift our praises unto thee
to thee we bring them seeking thy favour
accept them as a sweet-smelling savour
   
  
   
  
   
  
with thy sun thou our path dost brighten
as previous children lovest us thou
thou feedest us our burdens dost lighten
with copious crops us thou dost endow
the prayers of mortals lord thou heedest
and by thy grace their souls thou feedest
   
     
   
   
   
  

lord grant that in our habitations
with heart and tongue we’ll praise thee too
lifting our songs of adoration
to thee as fresh as morning dew
in our hearts we shall raise thee an altar
help us to praise thee and not falter
    
  
    
    
    
    


low in the grave he lay
jesus my saviour
waiting the coming day
jesus my lord
   
   
 
   
 

up from the grave he arose
with a mighty triumph o’er his foes
he arose a victor from the dark domain
and he lives forever with his saints to reign

   
     
     
      

he arose he arose
hallelujah christ arose

   
  

vainly they watched his bed
jesus my saviour
vainly they seal the dead
jesus my lord
 
 
   
 

up from the grave he arose
with a mighty triumph o’er his foes
he arose a victor from the dark domain
and he lives forever with his saints to reign

hallelujah christ arose

   
  

death cannot keep his prey
jesus my saviour
he tore the bars away
jesus my lord
 
 
  
 

up from the grave he arose
with a mighty triumph o’er his foes
he arose a victor from the dark domain
and he lives forever with his saints to reign

hallelujah christ arose

all this life to thee
in whatever worldly state
thou wilt have me be

not from sorrow pain or care
freedom dare i claim
this alone shall be my prayer
glorify thy name
  father let me dedicate


be glorified in me

can a child presume to choose
where or how to live
can a father’s love refuse
all the best to give

let my glad heart while it sings
thee in all proclaim
and whate’er the future brings
glorify thy name

in christ alone my hope is found
he is my light my strength my song
this cornerstone this solid ground
firm through the fiercest drought and storm

what heights of love what depths of peace
when fears are stilled when strivings cease
my comforter my all in all
here in the love of christ i stand
  in christ alone

in christ alonewho took on flesh
fullness of god in helpless babe
this gift of love and righteousness
scorned by the ones he came to save

till on the cross as jesus died
the wrath of god was satisfied
for ev’ry sin on him was laid
here in the death of christ i live

there in the ground his body lay
light of the world by darkness slain
then bursting forth in glorious day
up from the grave he rose again

and as he stands in victory
sin’s curse has lost its grip on me
for i am his and he is mine
bought with the precious blood of christ


no guilt in life no fear in death
this is the pow’r of christ in me
from life’s first cry to final breath
jesus commands my destiny

no pow’r of hell no scheme of man
can ever pluck me from his hand
till he returns or calls me home
here in the pow’r of christ i’ll stand


jesus is coming to earth again
what if it were today
coming in power and love to reign
what if it were today
   
    
   
    
   

coming to claim his chosen bride
all the redeemed and purified
over this whole earth scattered wide
what if it were today
    
   
   
   

glory glory
joy to my heart ’twill bring
glory glory
when we shall crown him king

 
   
 
   

glory glory
haste to prepare the way
glory glory
jesus will come some day
 
   
 
   

satan’s dominion will then be o’er
o that it were today
sorrow and sighing shall be no more
o that it were today
   
    
   
    

then shall the dead in christ arise
caught up to meet him in the skies
when shall these glories meet our eyes
what if it were today
   
    
   
   

glory glory
joy to my heart ’twill bring
glory glory
when we shall crown him king

 
   
 
   

glory glory
haste to prepare the way

faithful and true would he find us here
if he should come today
watching in gladness and not in fear
if he should come today
    
  
   
   

signs of his coming multiply
morning light breaks in eastern sky
watch for the time is drawing nigh
what if it were today

glory glory
when we shall crown him king

and darkness tries to hide
and trembles at his voice

safe in the arms of jesus
safe on his gentle breast
there by his love o’ershaded
sweetly my soul shall rest
   
   
   
    
    

hark ’tis the voice of angels
borne in a song to me
over the fields of glory
over the jasper sea
   
    
    
    

safe in the arms of jesus
safe on his gentle breast
there by his love o’ershaded
sweetly my soul shall rest

   
   
    
    

safe in the arms of jesus
safe from corroding care
safe from the world’s temptations
sin cannot harm me there
   
   
  
    

free from the blight of sorrow
free from my doubts and fears
only a few more trials
only a few more tears
   
  
    
  

safe in the arms of jesus
safe on his gentle breast
there by his love o’ershaded
sweetly my soul shall rest

jesus has died for me
firm on the rock of ages
ever my trust shall be
   
   
    
  

here let me wait with patience
wait till the night is o’er
wait till i see the morning
break on the golden shore
  
    
   
  


safe in the arms of jesus
safe on his gentle breast
there by his love o’ershaded
sweetly my soul shall rest

   
   
    
    




it’s your blood that cleanses me
it’s your blood that gives me life
it’s your blood that took my place
in redeeming sacrifice
and washes me whiter than the snow
than the snow
my jesus god’s precious sacrifice
it’s your blood


must jesus bear the cross alone
and all the world go free
no there’s a cross for everyone
and there’s a cross for me
    
     
    
   
   

how happy are the saints above
who once went sorrowing here
but now they taste unmingled love
and joy without a tear
   
  
    
  

the consecrated cross i’ll bear
till death shall set me free
and then go home my crown to wear
for there’s a crown for me
   
   
    
    

upon the crystal pavement down
at jesus’ piercd feet
joyful i’ll cast my golden crown
and his dear name repeat
   
  
    
   

o precious cross o glorious crown
o resurrection day
when christ the lord
from heav’n comes down
and bears my soul away
     ― 
   
    
    


i was sinking deep in sin
far from the peaceful shore
very deeply stained within
sinking to rise no more
     
   
    
  
  

but the master of the sea
heard my despairing cry
from the waters lifted me
now safe am i
   
  
    
  

love lifted me
love lifted me
when nothing else could help
love lifted me

 
 
   
 

all my heart to him i give
ever to him i’ll cling
in his blessed presence live
ever his praises sing
  
    
   
  

love so mighty and so true
merits my soul’s best songs
faithful loving service too
to him belongs
    
  
   
  

love lifted me
love lifted me
when nothing else could help
love lifted me

 
 
   
 

souls in danger look above
jesus completely saves
he will lift you by his love
out of the angry waves
 
  
  
  

he’s the master of the sea
billows his will obey
he your saviour wants to be
be saved today
     
  
    
  


love lifted me
love lifted me
when nothing else could help
love lifted me  

 
 
   
   


though i may speak with
the language of angels
and though i may fathom
all mysteries

see into the future
have faith that moves mountains
if i am without love
then what does it mean
  though i may speak



without love
it’s nothing at all
without love
without love
it’s nothing at all

and even if i gave
the poor my possessions
surrendered my body
and died for the cause

though highly respected
successful and gifted
if love was excluded
i’ve wasted it all



without love
it’s nothing at all
without love
without love
it’s nothing at all

and when we pass through the fire
nothing but love will survive


without love
it’s nothing at all
without love
without love
it’s nothing at all




and with you
jesus we see love
nothing but love will survive


sowing in the morning sowing seeds of kindness
sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve
waiting for the harvest and the time of reaping
we shall come rejoicing bringing in the sheaves
  
     
       
     
    

bringing in the sheaves bringing in the sheaves
we shall come rejoicing bringing in the sheaves
bringing in the sheaves bringing in the sheaves
we shall come rejoicing bringing in the sheaves

   
    
   
    

sowing in the sunshine sowing in the shadows
fearing neither clouds nor winter’s chilling breeze
by and by the harvest and the labour ended
we shall come rejoicing bringing in the sheaves
      
    
     
    

bringing in the sheaves bringing in the sheaves
we shall come rejoicing bringing in the sheaves
bringing in the sheaves bringing in the sheaves
we shall come rejoicing bringing in the sheaves

   
    
   
    

going forth with weeping sowing for the master
though the loss sustained our spirit often grieves
when our weeping’s over he will bid us welcome
we shall come rejoicing bringing in the sheaves
     
     
    
    


bringing in the sheaves bringing in the sheaves
we shall come rejoicing bringing in the sheaves
bringing in the sheaves bringing in the sheaves
we shall come rejoicing bringing in the sheaves

   
    
   
    



heal me o lord
and i will be healed
save me and i will be saved

heal me o lord
and i will be healed
for you are the one i praise
you are the one i praise
  heal me o lord


o that i had a thousand voices
and with a thousand tongues could tell
of him in whom the earth rejoices
who does all things wisely and well
      
      
   
   
    

my grateful heart would then be free
to tell what god has done for me
     
       
o all you pow’rs that god implanted
arise and silence keep no more
put forth the strength that god has
granted
your noblest work is to adore
      
    
     
     

o soul and body join to raise
with heartfelt joy our maker’s praise
    
   

you forest leaves so green and tender
that dance for joy in summer air
you meadow grasses bright and slender
you flow’rs so wond’rous sweet so fair
   
  
    
     

you live to show god’s praise alone
with me now make his glory known
   
    
all creatures that have breath and
motion
that throng the earth the sea the sky
now join with me my heart’s devotion
help me to raise his praises high
    
   
    
    

my utmost pow’rs can ne’er aright
declare the wonders of god’s might
    
    
   
  
     
  

o father deign thou i beseech thee
to listen to my earthly lays
a nobler strain in heav’n shall reach thee
when i with angels hymn thy praise

    
    

and learn amid their choirs to sing
loud hallelujahs to my king


love divine all loves excelling
joy of heav’n to earth come down
fix in us thy humble dwelling
all thy faithful mercies crown
   
 
  
    
    

jesus thou art all compassion
pure unbounded love thou art
visit us with thy salvation
enter ev’ry trembling heart
   
  
    
   

breathe o breathe thy loving spirit
into ev’ry troubled breast
let us all in thee inherit
let us find thy promised rest
   
   
  
  

take away our bent to sinning
alpha and omega be
end of faith as its beginning
set our hearts at liberty
    
  
   
   

come almighty to deliver
let us all thy life receive
suddenly return and never
nevermore thy temples leave
   
   
  
   

thee we would be always blessing
serve thee as thy hosts above
pray and praise thee without ceasing
glory in thy perfect love
    
    
  
  

finish then thy new creation
pure and spotless let us be
let us see thy great salvation
perfectly restored in thee
   
 
    
  


changed from glory into glory
’til in heav’n we take our place
till we cast our crowns before thee
lost in wonder love and praise
    
   
   
 


“almost persuaded”
now to believe
“almost persuaded”
christ to receive
 
 
  
  
 

seems now some soul to say
“go spirit go thy way
some more convenient day
on thee i’ll call”
 -  
  
   
  

“almost persuaded”
come come today
“almost persuaded”
turn not away
  
  
  
  

jesus invites you here
angels are lingering near
prayers rise from hearts so dear
o wanderer come
  
  
   
 

“almost persuaded”
harvest is past
“almost persuaded”
doom comes at last
  
 
  
 


“almost” cannot avail
“almost” is but to fail
sad sad that bitter wail
“almost” but lost
   
  
   
  


an open bible for the world
may this our glorious motto be
on ev’ry breeze its flag unfurled
shall scatter blessings rich and free
  
  
     
    
   

blest word of god send forth thy light
o’er every land and every sea
till all who wander in the night
are led to god and heaven by thee

    
    
    
   

where’er it goes its golden light
streaming as from an unveiled sun
shall dissipate the clouds of night
undo the work that sin has done
   
   
    
    

blest word of god send forth thy light
o’er every land and every sea
till all who wander in the night
are led to god and heaven by thee

    
    
    
   

it shows to men the father’s face
all radiant with forgiving love
and to the lost of adam’s race
proclaims sweet mercy from above
  
    
   
   

blest word of god send forth thy light
o’er every land and every sea
till all who wander in the night
are led to god and heaven by thee

    
    
    
   

it offers rest to weary hearts
it comforts those who sit in tears
to all who faint it strength imparts
and gilds with hope th’ eternal years
    
    
     
  


blest word of god send forth thy light
o’er every land and every sea
till all who wander in the night
are led to god and heaven by thee

as news of your impending death
to your disciples broke
and lovingly you took the bread
and words of blessing spoke
-    
  
   
  ’  
  
the bread you broke and with these
words
distributed to all
“this is my bodytake and eat
partake of it all of you”
  
  
„      
  ”

and then o lord you took the cup
and prayed and then you said
“this is my bloodby it for sins
atonement will be made”
     
„   
  ”   
„    ”

“this is the covenant of blood
no other can there be
whene’er you do it do it in
remembrance friends of me”
„     
   
    
   ”

your blood we would remember lord
for us shed on the tree
your mutilated body too
o let us ever see
    
    
    
    


possess our thoughts that ever we
may seek the reason why
why you on calv’ry’s rugged cross
chose such a death to die
    
   
     
  


on a hill far away
stood an old rugged cross
the emblem of suffering and shame
and i love that old cross
where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain
  

      
    
      
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

     
    
      
     

oh that old rugged cross
so despised by the world
has a wondrous attraction for me
for the dear lamb of god left his glory above
to bear it to dark calvary
       
      
       
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

     
    
      
     

to the old rugged cross i will ever be true
it’s shame and reproach gladly bear
then he’ll call me some day
to my home far away
where his glory forever i’ll share
       
   
      
    


so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

     
    
      
     


i grieved my lord from day to day
i scorned his love so full and free
and though i wandered far away
my mother’s prayers have followed me
   
   
    
     
  

i’m coming home i’m coming home
to live my wasted life anew
for mother’s prayers have followed me
have followed me the whole world thro’

    
   
     
  

o’er desert wild o’er mountain high
a wanderer i chose to be
a wretched soul condemned to die
still mother’s prayers have followed me
     
     
  
  

i’m coming home i’m coming home
to live my wasted life anew
for mother’s prayers have followed me
have followed me the whole world thro’

    
   
     
  

he turned my darkness into light
this blessd christ of calvary
i’ll praise his name both day and night
that mother’s prayers have followed me
    
    
    
  


i’m coming home i’m coming home
to live my wasted life anew
for mother’s prayers have followed me
have followed me the whole world thro’

    
   
     
  


i love to think of the heavenly land
where white-robed angels are
where many a friend is gathered safe
from fear and toil and care
    
    
  
    
  

there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting there

  
  
  
   

i love to think of the heavenly land
where my redeemer reigns
where rapturous songs of triumph rise
in endless joyous strains
    
   
    
  

there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting there

  
  
  
   
i love to think of the heavenly land
the saints’ eternal home
where palms and robes and crowns
ne’er fade
and all our joys are one
    
  
    
  

there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting there

  
  
  
   

i love to think of the heavenly land
that promised land so fair
oh how my raptured spirit longs
to be forever there
    
   
   
   


there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting there

  
  
  
   


i know not why god’s wond’rous grace
to me he hath made known
nor why unworthy christ in love
redeemed me for his own
   
   
  
   
    

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

      
     
    
    

i know not how this saving faith
to me he did impart
nor how believing in his word
wrought peace within my heart
     
   
     
 

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

      
     
    
    

i know not how the spirit moves
convincing men of sin
revealing jesus through the word
creating faith in him
     
   
    
  

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

      
     
    
    

i know not what of good or ill
may be reserved for me
of weary ways or golden days
before his face i see
      
 
     
  

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

      
     
    
    

i know not when my lord may come
at night or noonday fair
nor if i’ll walk the vale with him
or meet him in the air
    
  
      
    


but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

      
     
    
    


sowing in the morning sowing seeds of kindness
sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve
waiting for the harvest and the time of reaping
we shall come rejoicing bringing in the sheaves
-   
    
      
    
     

bringing in the sheaves bringing in the sheaves
we shall come rejoicing bringing in the sheaves
bringing in the sheaves bringing in the sheaves
we shall come rejoicing bringing in the sheaves

   
     
   
     

sowing in the sunshine sowing in the shadows
fearing neither clouds nor winter’s chilling breeze
by and by the harvest and the labour ended
we shall come rejoicing bringing in the sheaves
        
      
    
     

bringing in the sheaves bringing in the sheaves
we shall come rejoicing bringing in the sheaves
bringing in the sheaves bringing in the sheaves
we shall come rejoicing bringing in the sheaves

   
     
   
     

going forth with weeping sowing for the master
though the loss sustained our spirit often grieves
when our weeping’s over he will bid us welcome
we shall come rejoicing bringing in the sheaves
    
    
     
     


bringing in the sheaves bringing in the sheaves
we shall come rejoicing bringing in the sheaves
bringing in the sheaves bringing in the sheaves
we shall come rejoicing bringing in the sheaves

when i survey the wondrous cross
on which the prince of glory died
my richest gain i count but loss
and pour contempt on all my pride
   
   
     
   
   

forbid it lord that i should boast
save in the death of christ my god
all the vain things that charm me most
i sacrifice them to his blood
    
     
     
   

see from his head his hands his feet
sorrow and love flow mingled down
did e’er such love and sorrow meet
or thorns compose so rich a crown
   
     
   
   


were the whole realm of nature mine
that were a present far too small
love so amazing so divine
demands my soul my life my all

crown him with many crowns
the lamb upon his throne
hark how the heavenly anthem drowns
all music but its own
  
  
   
   
  

awake my soul and sing
of him who died for thee
and hail him as thy matchless king
through all eternity
   
   
 ―   
 ―   

crown him the lord of love
behold his hands and side
rich wounds yet visible above
in beauty glorified
  
  
    
    

no angel in the sky
can fully bear that sight
but downward bends his wondering eye
at mysteries so bright
  
   
   
     

crown him the lord of life
who triumphed o’er the grave
who rose victorious to the strife
for those he came to save
  
  
    
  

his glories now we sing
who died and rose on high
who died eternal life to bring
and lives that death may die
   
  ―   
     
    

crown him the lord of heaven
one with the father known
one with the spirit through him given
from yonder glorious throne

thy praise and glory shall not fail
throughout eternity

alas and did my saviour bleed
and did my sovereign die
would he devote that sacred head
for sinners such as i
   
   
 
  
   

at the cross at the cross
where i first saw the light
and the burden of my heart rolled away
it was there by faith i received my sight
and now i am happy all the day

   
  
     
    
     


thy body slain sweet jesus thine
and bathed in its own blood
while the firm mark of wrath divine
his soul in anguish stood
   
   
    
  

at the cross at the cross
where i first saw the light
and the burden of my heart rolled away
it was there by faith i received my sight
and now i am happy all the day

   
  
     
    
     


well might the sun in darkness hide
and shut his glories in
when christ the mighty maker died
for man the creature’s sin
     
  
  
   

at the cross at the cross
where i first saw the light
and the burden of my heart rolled away
it was there by faith i received my sight
and now i am happy all the day

   
  
     
    
     


thus might i hide my blushing face
while his dear cross appears
dissolve my heart in thankfulness
and melt my eyes to tears
    
   
    
  

at the cross at the cross
where i first saw the light
and the burden of my heart rolled away
it was there by faith i received my sight
and now i am happy all the day

   
  
     
    
     


but drops of grief can ne’er repay
the debt of love i owe
here lord i give my self away

o lord my god when i in awesome wonder
consider all the worlds thy hands have made
i see the stars i hear the rolling thunder
thy pow’r throughout the universe displayed
   
      
      
      
    

then sings my soul my saviour god to thee
how great thou art how great thou art
then sings my soul my saviour god to thee
how great thou art how great thou art

     
     
     
     

when through the woods
and forest glades i wander
and hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees
when i look down from lofty mountain grandeur
and hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze
    
  
    
      
    

then sings my soul my saviour god to thee
how great thou art how great thou art

how great thou art how great thou art
then sings my soul my saviour god to thee
how great thou art how great thou art

     
     
     
     

and when i think that god his son not sparing
sent him to die i scarce can take it in
that on the cross my burden gladly bearing
he bled and died to take away my sin
     
      
      
    

then sings my soul my saviour god to thee
how great thou art how great thou art

homeward bound homeward bound
from a world where deceptions abound
i escape and i run
to the land of the ne’er-setting sun

   
   
   
   

the mist of the evening grows dark
as i travel this vale full of tears
yet my trust in the lord wavers not
in his presence i’ll rest from all fears
  
     
    
    

homeward bound homeward bound
from a world where deceptions abound
i escape and i run

from care he sets me free

his eye is on the sparrow
and i know he watches me

breaketh
when the bird waketh and the shadows flee
fairer than morning lovelier than daylight
dawns the sweet consciousness i am with thee
  
    
 
    
      
     

alone with thee amid the mystic shadows
the solemn hush of nature newly born
alone with thee in breathless adoration
in the calm dew and freshness of the morn
     
     
     
      

still still with thee as to each newborn morning
a fresh and solemn splendour still is given
so does this blessd consciousness awaking
breath each day nearness unto thee
and heaven
    
     
    
     


so shall it be at last in that bright morning
when the soul waketh and life’s shadows flee
o in that hour fairer than daylight dawning
shall rise the glorious thought i am with thee

as news of your impending death
to your disciples broke
and lovingly you took the bread
and words of blessing spoke
  
  
   
     
  
the bread you broke and with these
words
distributed to all
“this is my bodytake and eat
partake of it all of you”
    
   
   
   

and then o lord you took the cup
and prayed and then you said
“this is my bloodby it for sins
atonement will be made”
     
    
     
   

“this is the covenant of blood
no other can there be
whene’er you do it do it in
remembrance friends of me”
     
   
   
  

your blood we would remember lord
for us shed on the tree
your mutilated body too
o let us ever see
     
  
  
    


possess our thoughts that ever we
may seek the reason why
why you on calv’ry’s rugged cross
chose such a death to die

my precious blood i shed
that thou might’st ransomed be
and quickened from the dead

what hast thou giv’n for me
i gave i gave my life for thee
what hast thou giv’n for me
   
    
   
    

my father’s house of light
my glory-circled throne
i left for earthly night
for wand’rings sad and lone
   
   
    
   

i left i left it all for thee
hast thou left aught for me
i left i left it all for thee
hast thou left aught for me
    
    
    
    

i suffered much for thee
more than thy tongue can tell
of bitt’rest agony
to rescue thee from hell
  
   
  
  

i’ve borne i’ve borne it all for thee
what hast thou borne for me
i’ve borne i’ve borne it all for thee
what hast thou borne for me
    
    
    
    

and i have brought to thee
down from my home above
salvation full and free
my pardon and my love

what hast thou brought to me
i bring i bring rich gifts to thee
what hast thou brought to me

come thou fount of every blessing
tune my heart to sing thy grace
streams of mercy never ceasing
call for songs of loudest praise
   
   
     
   
   

teach me some melodious sonnet
sung by flaming tongues above
praise the mount i’m fixed upon it
mount of god’s unchanging love
    
   
  
  

here i raise my ebenezer
hither by thy help i come
and i hope by thy good pleasure
safely to arrive at home
   -
   
     
    

jesus sought me when a stranger
wand’ring from the fold of god
he to rescue me from danger
interposed his precious blood
    
   
  
  

oh to grace how great a debtor
daily i’m constrained to be
let thy grace lord like a fetter
bind my wand’ring heart to thee
   
   
  
   


prone to wander lord i feel it
prone to leave the god i love
here’s my heart lord take and seal it
seal it for thy courts above
   
   
   
  


at even ere the sun was set
the sick o lord around thee lay
o with how many pains they met
o with what joy they went away
  
     
   
   
  

once more ’tis eventide and we
oppressed with various ills draw near
what if thyself we cannot see
we know that thou art ever near
     
    
    
     

o saviour christ our woes dispel
for some are sick and some are sad
and some have never loved thee well
and some have lost the love they had
   
    
   
    

o saviour christ thou too art man
thou has been troubled tempted tried
thy kind but searching glance can scan
the very wounds that shame would hide
     
    
   
     


thy touch has still its ancient power
no word from thee can fruitless fall
hear in this solemn evening hour
and in thy mercy heal us all

singing if my way is clear
praying if the path be drear
if in danger for him call
trusting jesus that is all
     
   
      
   

trusting as the moments fly
trusting as the days go by
trusting him whate’er befall
trusting jesus that is all

   
   
       
   

trusting him while life shall last
trusting him till earth be past

trusting jesus that is all
   
    
    
   


trusting as the moments fly
trusting as the days go by
trusting him whate’er befall
trusting jesus that is all

   
   
       
   


when peace like a river attendeth my way
when sorrows like sea billows roll
whatever my lot thou hast taught me to say
“it is well it is well with my soul”
   
     
    
    
    


it is well it is well
with my soul with my soul
it is well it is well with my soul

     
   
    
though satan should buffet
though trials should come
let blessed assurance control
that christ hath regarded my helpless estate
and has shed his own blood for my soul
     
   
      
   


it is well it is well
with my soul with my soul
it is well it is well with my soul

     
   
    

my sin o the bliss of this glorious thought
my sin not in part but the whole
is nailed to the cross and i bear it no more
praise the lord praise the lord o my soul
      
     
      
  


it is well it is well
with my soul with my soul
it is well it is well with my soul

     
   
    

for me be it christ be it christ hence to live
if jordan above me shall roll
no pang shall be mine for in death as in life
thou wilt whisper thy peace to my soul
       
     
     
    


it is well it is well
with my soul with my soul
it is well it is well with my soul

     
   
    
o lord haste the day when my faith
shall be sight
the clouds be rolled back as a scroll
the trump shall resound and the lord
shall descend
“even so” it is well with my soul
    
   
      
    



it is well it is well
with my soul with my soul
it is well it is well with my soul

on a hill far away
stood an old rugged cross
the emblem of suffering and shame
and i love that old cross
where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain
-    

      
     
      
      

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

     
    
     
     

oh that old rugged cross
so despised by the world
has a wondrous attraction for me
for the dear lamb of god left his glory above
to bear it to dark calvary
      

     
       

     

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

     
    
     
     
in that old rugged cross
stained with blood so divine
a wondrous beauty i see
for ’twas on that old cross
jesus suffered and died
to pardon and sanctify me
       
    
      
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

     
    
     
     

to the old rugged cross i will ever be true
it’s shame and reproach gladly bear
then he’ll call me some day
to my home far away
where his glory forever i’ll share
     
     
       
      


so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

o holy night the stars are brightly shining
it is the night of the dear saviour’s birth
long lay the world in sin and error pining
till he appeared and the soul felt its worth
 
    
     
      
     

a thrill of hope the weary soul rejoices
for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
fall on your knees o hear the angel voices
o night divine o night when christ was born

the king of kings lay thus in lowly manger
in all our trials born to be our friend
he knows our needto our weakness is
no stranger
behold your king before him lowly bend
behold your king before him lowly bend

his law is love and his gospel is peace
chains shall he break for the slave is
our brother
and in his name all oppression shall cease

come holy spirit heavenly dove
with all thy quick’ning powers
kindle a flame of sacred love
in these cold hearts of ours
   
     
  
    
  

in vain we tune our formal songs
in vain we strive to rise
hosannas languish on our tongues
and our devotion dies
   
  
     
  

dear lord and shall we ever live
at this poor dying rate
our love so faint so cold to thee
and thine to us so great
   
   
     
    


come holy spirit heavenly dove
with all thy quick’ning powers
come shed abroad the saviour’s love
and that shall kindle ours
     
   
    
   


o worship the king all glorious above
and gratefully sing his pow’r and his love
our shield and defender the ancient of days
pavilioned in splendour and girded with praise
    
   
      
     
   
o tell of his might and sing of his grace
whose robe is the light whose canopy space
his chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds
form
and dark is his path on the wings of the storm
    
      
      
   
thy bountiful care what tongue can recite
it breathes in the air it shines in the light
it streams from the hills it descends to
the plain
and sweetly distils in the dew and the rain
    
      
       
     


frail children of dust and feeble as frail
in thee do we trust nor find thee to fail
thy mercies how tender how firm to the end
our maker defender redeemer and friend

a mighty fortress is our god
a bulwark never failing
our helper he amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing
    
    
    
     
    
for still our ancient foe
doth seek to work us woe
his craft and power are great
and armed with cruel hate
on earth is not his equal
    
  
   
   
    

did we in our own strength confide
our striving would be losing
were not the right man on our side
the man of god’s own choosing
   
  
    
  
dost ask who that may be
christ jesus it is he
lord sabaoth his name
from age to age the same
and he must win the battle
   
  
    
       
 

and though this world with devils filled
should threaten to undo us
we will not fear for god hath willed
his truth to triumph through us
   
   
   
  
the prince of darkness grim
we tremble not for him
his rage we can endure
for lo his doom is sure
one little word shall fell him
    
   
   
   
  

that word above all earthly powers
no thanks to them abideth
the spirit and the gifts are ours
through him who with us sideth
  
   
   
 

let goods and kindred go
this mortal life also
the body they may kill
god’s truth abideth still
his kingdom is forever

when i was but a little child
how well i recollect
how i would grieve my mother
with my folly and neglect
    
    
  
    
  

and now that she has gone to heav’n
i miss her tender care
o saviour tell my mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there
    
   
  
     

tell mother i’ll be there
in answer to her prayer
this message blessd saviour
to her bear

   
  
 
  

tell mother i’ll be there
heav’n’s joys with her to share
yes tell my darling mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there
   
     
  
     

though i was often wayward
she was always kind and good
so patient gentle loving
when i acted rough and rude
   
    
    
  

my childhood griefs and trials
she would gladly with me share
o saviour tell my mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there
   
 
  
     

tell mother i’ll be there
in answer to her prayer
this message blessd saviour
to her bear

   
  
 
  

tell mother i’ll be there
heav’n’s joys with her to share
yes tell my darling mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there
   
     
  
     

when i became a prodigal
and left the old roof-tree
she almost broke her loving heart
in mourning after me
    
    
   
   

and day and night she prayed to god
to keep me in his care
o saviour tell my mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there
     
   
  
     

tell mother i’ll be there
in answer to her prayer
this message blessd saviour
to her bear

   
  
 
  

tell mother i’ll be there
heav’n’s joys with her to share
yes tell my darling mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there
   
     
  
     

one day a message came to me
it bade me quickly come
if i would see my mother
ere the saviour took her home
    
   
   
   

i promised her before she died
for heaven to prepare
o saviour tell my mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there
     
  
  
     

tell mother i’ll be there
in answer to her prayer
this message blessd saviour
to her bear

   
  
 
  


tell mother i’ll be there
heav’n’s joys with her to share
yes tell my darling mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there

i will guide thee i will guide thee

and found in thee alone
the peace the joy i sought so long
the bliss till now unknown

there’s a church in the valley
by the wildwood
no lovelier spot in the dale
no place is so dear to my childhood
as the little brown church in the vale
-     

    
     
     
  

come to the church in the wildwood
oh come to the church in the vale
no spot is so dear to my childhood
as the little brown church in the vale

     
     
   
   

how sweet on a clear sabbath morning
to list’n to the clear ringing bell
its tones so sweetly are calling
oh come to the church in the vale
   
    
   
   

come to the church in the wildwood
oh come to the church in the vale
no spot is so dear to my childhood
as the little brown church in the vale

     
     
   
   
there close by the church in the valley
lies one that i loved so well
she sleeps sweetly sleeps ’neath
the willow
disturb not her rest in the vale
      
    
   
    

come to the church in the wildwood
oh come to the church in the vale
no spot is so dear to my childhood
as the little brown church in the vale

     
     
   
   
there close by the side of that loved one
to the trees where the wild flowers
bloom
where the farewell hymn will be chanted
i shall rest by her side in the tomb
   
    
   
 ―   

come to the church in the wildwood
oh come to the church in the vale
no spot is so dear to my childhood
as the little brown church in the vale

     
     
   
   
from the church in the valley
by the wildwood
when day fades away into night
i would fain from this spot of my
childhood
wing my way to the mansions of light

    
    
  
    


come to the church in the wildwood
oh come to the church in the vale
no spot is so dear to my childhood

i enter the holy of holies
i enter through the blood of the lamb
i enter to worship you only
i enter to honour “i am”

lord i worship you i worship you
lord i worship you i worship you
for your name is holy holy lord

i come to the garden alone
while the dew is still on the roses
and the voice i hear falling on my ear
the son of god discloses
     
     
   
       
   

and he walks with me
and he talks with me
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known

      
  
      
   


he speaks and the sound of his voice
is so sweet the birds hush their singing
and the melody that he gave to me
within my heart is ringing
    
  
     
    

and he walks with me
and he talks with me
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known

      
  
      
   

i’d stay in the garden with him
though the night around me be falling
but he bids me go through the
voice of woe
his voice to me is calling
    
   
       
   


and he walks with me
and he talks with me
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known

      
  
      
   


it came upon the midnight clear
that glorious song of old
from angels bending near the earth
to touch their harps of gold
  
    
   
   
   

“peace on the earth good will to men
from heaven’s all-gracious king”
the world in solemn stillness lay
to hear the angels sing
    
  
    
  

still thro’ the cloven skies they come
with peaceful wings unfurled
and still their heavenly music floats
o’er all the weary world
   
  
     
  

above its sad and lowly plains
they bend on hovering wing
and ever o’er its babel sounds
the blessed angels sing
     
   
   
  

and ye beneath life’s crushing load
whose forms are bending low
who toil along the climbing way
with painful steps and slow
    
 
   
  

look now for glad and golden hours
come swiftly on the wing
o rest beside the weary road
and hear the angels sing
   
  
    
  

for lo the days are hastening on
by prophet bards foretold
when with the ever-circling years
comes round the age of gold
   
 
    
  


when peace shall over all the earth
its ancient splendours fling
and the whole world give back the song
which now the angels sing
   
  
    
   


i need thee ev’ry hour
most gracious lord
no tender voice like thine
can peace afford
    
    
  
   
  

i need thee o i need thee
ev’ry hour i need thee
o bless me now my saviour
i come to thee

   
    
   
  

i need thee ev’ry hour
stay thou near by
temptations lose their power
when thou art nigh
    
 
  
 

i need thee o i need thee
ev’ry hour i need thee
o bless me now my saviour
i come to thee

   
    
   
  

i need thee ev’ry hour
in joy or pain
come quickly and abide
or life is vain
    
 
   
  

i need thee o i need thee
ev’ry hour i need thee
o bless me now my saviour
i come to thee

   
    
   
  

i need thee ev’ry hour
teach me thy will
and thy rich promises
in me fulfil
    
 
   
 

i need thee o i need thee
ev’ry hour i need thee
o bless me now my saviour
i come to thee

   
    
   
  

i need thee ev’ry hour
most holy one
oh make me thine indeed
thou blessed son
    
   
   
 


i need thee o i need thee
ev’ry hour i need thee
o bless me now my saviour
i come to thee

with the waves of ripened grain
far and near their gold is gleaming
o’er the sunny slope and plain
      
    
    
  
  

lord of harvest send forth reapers
hear us lord to thee we cry
send them now the sheaves to gather
ere the harvest time pass by

when the sun’s last rays are gleaming
bid them gather everywhere
   
    
    
  

lord of harvest send forth reapers
hear us lord to thee we cry
send them now the sheaves to gather
ere the harvest time pass by

heav’nward then at evening wending
thou shalt come with joy untold

leave to thy god to order and provide
in ev’ry change he faithful will remain
be still my soul thy best thy heavenly friend
thro’ thorny ways leads to a joyful end
 
     
      
       
      
     
      
be still my soul thy god doth undertake
to guide the future as he has the past
thy hope thy confidence let nothing shake
all now mysterious shall be bright at last
be still my soul the waves and winds still know
his voice who ruled them while he dwelt below

when we shall be forever with the lord
when disappointment grief and fear are gone
sorrow forgot love’s purest joys restored
be still my soul when change and tears are past
all safe and blessed we shall meet at last

me to wrong

o come mighty ocean
and roll over me

they roll over me
  ’   
’      
     ’   
   
  


and now hallelujah the rest of my days
shall gladly be spent in promoting his praise
who opened his bosom to pour out this sea
of boundless salvation
for you and for me

o little town of bethlehem
how still we see thee lie
above thy deep and dreamless sleep
the silent stars go by
   
   
   
   
  

yet in thy dark streets shineth
the everlasting light
the hopes and fears of all the years
are met in thee tonight
  
  
   
   

for christ is born of mary
and gathered all above
while mortals sleep the angels keep
their watch of wondering love
    
    
      
 

o morning stars together
proclaim the holy birth
and praises sing to god the king
and peace to men on earth
    
   
     
   

how silently how silently
the wondrous gift is giv’n
so god imparts to human hearts
the blessings of his heaven
    
    
   
   

no ear may hear his coming
but in this world of sin
where meek souls will receive him still
the dear christ enters in
  
    
    
 

o holy child of bethlehem
descend to us we pray
cast out our sin and enter in
be born in us today

though troubles assail us
and dangers affright
though friends should all fail us

yet one thing secures us
whatever betide
the promise assures us
“the lord will provide”

or storehouse are fed
from them let us learn to
trust god for our bread

“the lord will provide”

to stop up our path
and courage all fails us

he cannot take from us
though oft he has tried
this heart-cheering promise
“the lord will provide”
  
 
  
 

no strength of our own
and no goodness we claim
yet since we have known
of the saviour’s great name
  
    
  
  


in this our strong tower
for safety we hide
the lord is our power
“the lord will provide”

i have placed all my hope
in a crucified man
in the wounds in his side
his feet and his hands

i have traded my pride
for a share in his shame
and the glory that one day
will burst from his pain
  i have placed all my hope

i’ve abandoned my trust
in the wise and the proud
for this fragile mysterious
weakness of god

and i dare to believe
in his scandalous claim
that his blood cleanses sin
for whoever will call on his name



live or die here i stand
i’ve placed my hope
in a crucified man

i believe as they beat
on his beautiful face
he turned a torturer’s chair
to an altar of grace

where the worst we can do
met the best that god does
where unspeakable hate
met the gaze of unstoppable love



at the crux of it all there he hangs
i’ve placed my hope in a crucified
man of sorrows man of grief
will he stay beyond belief

when the purest and best
took the force of our curse
death’s vict’ry armada
juddered into reverse

and either we bow
or we stumble and fall
for the wisdom of a suffering god
has made fools of us all



i gladly admit that i am
but i’ve placed my hope in a crucified
man of sorrows man of grief
will he stay beyond belief

i have buried my life
in the cold earth with him
like a seed in the winter
i wait for the spring

from that garden of tombs
eden rises again
and paradise blooms
from his body and never will end



he’ll finish all he began
creation hopes
in a crucified man


when i stand at the judgement
i have no other plan
i’ve placed my hope
in a crucified man

like the thief nailed beside him
i have no other plan
i’ve placed my hope
in a crucified man

i belong to the king
i’m a child of his love
i shall dwell in his palace so fair
for he tells of its bliss
in yon heaven above
and his children in splendour shall share
  

  
   
      
  
  
    

i belong to the king i’m a child of his love
and he never forsaketh his own
he will call me some day to his palace above
i shall dwell by his glorified throne

  
   
    
     
    
     
i belong to the king
and he loves me i know
for his mercy and kindness so free
are unceasingly mine
wheresoever i go
and my refuge unfailing is he

  
  
     
 
      
       

i belong to the king i’m a child of his love

i belong to the king
and his promise is sure
that we all shall be gathered at last
in his kingdom above
by life’s waters so pure
when this life with its trials is past

  
  
      
  
   
    


i belong to the king i’m a child of his love

still may we dwell secure
sufficient is thine arm alone
and our defence is sure
    
 
  
   

before the hills in order stood
or earth received her frame
from everlasting thou art god
to endless years the same
  
   
    
      

a thousand ages in thy sight
are like an evening gone
short as the watch that ends the night
before the rising sun
    
  
     
  

time like an ever rolling stream
bears all its sons away
they fly forgotten as a dream
dies at the opening day
  
   
    
    


o god our help in ages past
our hope for years to come
be thou my guide while life shall last
and our eternal home
    
   
     
   


i know not why god’s wond’rous grace
to me he hath made known
nor why unworthy christ in love
redeemed me for his own
-      
    
  
   
   

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

     
     
   
     

i know not how this saving faith
to me he did impart
nor how believing in his word
wrought peace within my heart
     
  
    
  

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

     
     
   
     

i know not how the spirit moves
convincing men of sin
revealing jesus through the word
creating faith in him
     
   
   
  

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

     
     
   
     

i know not when my lord may come
at night or noonday fair
nor if i’ll walk the vale with him
or meet him in the air
     
   ―
     
    


but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed

“be ye strong in the lord
and the power of his might”
firmly standing for the truth
of his word
 
 
  
     

he shall lead you safely through
the thickest of the fight
you shall conquer in the name
of the lord
   
   
     

firmly stand for the right
on to vict’ry at the king’s command

   
    

for the honour of the lord
and the triumph of his word
in the strength of the lord
firmly stand
  
  
     

“be ye strong in the lord
and the power of his might”
never turning from the face 
of the foe
 
  
     

he will surely by you stand
as you battle for the right

never fail
 
  
    

he will hold thy right hand
while battling for the right
trusting him thou shalt
for evermore prevail
   
   
     

firmly stand for the right

thou didst leave thy throne
and thy kingly crown
when thou camest to earth for me
but in bethlehem’s home
was there found no room
for thy holy nativity
  

      
   
      
   


o come to my heart lord jesus
there is room in my heart for thee

      
     

heaven’s arches rang when the angels sang
proclaiming thy royal decree
but of lowly birth didst thou come to earth
and in great humility
    
  
     
    


o come to my heart lord jesus
there is room in my heart for thee

      
     

thou camest o lord with the living word
that should set thy people free
but with mocking scorn and with crown of thorn
they bore thee to calvary
     
   
     
   


o come to my heart lord jesus
there is room in my heart for thee

      
     

when the heavens shall ring and the angels sing
at thy coming to victory
let thy voice call me home
saying “yet there is room
there is room at my side for thee”
    
     
     
     



and my heart shall rejoice lord jesus
when thou comest and callest me

      
     


god moves in a mysterious way
his wonders to perform
he plants his footsteps in the sea
and rides upon the storm
    
  
  
   
     

deep in unfathomable mines
of never-failing skill
he treasures up his bright designs
and works his sovereign will
  
   
     
   

ye fearful saints fresh courage take
the clouds ye so much dread
are big with mercy and shall break
in blessings on your head
   
 
   
  

judge not the lord by feeble sense
but trust him for his grace
behind a frowning providence
he hides a smiling face
  
  
  
  

his purposes will ripen fast
unfolding every hour
the bud may have a bitter taste
but sweet will be the flower
  
   
   
    


blind unbelief is sure to err
and scan his work in vain
god is his own interpreter
and he will make it plain
    
    
    
 


o lord you’re beautiful
your face is all i seek
for when your eyes are on this child
your grace abounds to me

o lord please light the fire
that once burned bright and clear
replace the lamp of my first love
that burns with holy fear
o lord you’re beautiful


i wanna take your word
and shine it all around
but first help me just to live it lord
and when i’m doing well
help me to never seek a crown
for my reward is giving glory to you



o lord you’re beautiful
your face is all i seek
for when your eyes are on this child
your grace abounds to me


the church’s one foundation
is jesus christ her lord
she is his new creation
by water and the word
   
   
    
  
 

from heav’n he came and sought her
to be his holy bride
with his own blood he bought her
and for her life he died
    
   
  
   

she is from ev’ry nation
yet one o’er all the earth
her charter of salvation
one lord one faith one birth
 
  
  
 

one holy name she blesses
partakes one holy food
and to one hope she presses
with ev’ry grace endued
  
  
  
  

though with a scornful wonder
men see her sore oppressed
by schisms rent asunder
by heresies distressed
 
 
  
 

yet saints their watch are keeping
their cry goes up “how long”
and soon the night of weeping
shall be the morn of song
   
   
  
  

’mid toil and tribulation
and tumult of her war
she waits the consummation
of peace forevermore
   
   
  
  

till with the vision glorious
her longing eyes are blest
and the great church victorious
shall be the church at rest
  
  
  
 

yet she on earth hath union
with god the three in one
and mystic sweet communion
with those whose rest is won
    
    
  
 


with all her sons and daughters
who by the master’s hand
led through the deathly waters
repose in eden land

years i spent in vanity and pride
caring not my lord was crucified
knowing not it was for me he died
on calvary
    
    
      
    
  

mercy there was great and grace was free
pardon there was multiplied to me
there my burdened soul found liberty
at calvary

   
    
   
  

by god’s word at last my sin i learned
then i trembled at the law i’d spurned
till my guilty soul imploring turned
to calvary
    
    
    
  

mercy there was great and grace was free
pardon there was multiplied to me
there my burdened soul found liberty
at calvary

   
    
   
  

now i’ve giv’n to jesus ev’rything
now i gladly own him as my king
now my raptured soul can only sing
of calvary
   
      
   
  

mercy there was great and grace was free
pardon there was multiplied to me
there my burdened soul found liberty
at calvary

   
    
   
  

o the love that drew salvation’s plan
o the grace that brought it down to man
o the mighty gulf that god did span
at calvary
    
   
   
  


mercy there was great and grace was free
pardon there was multiplied to me
there my burdened soul found liberty
at calvary

   
    
   
  


as sure as jesus lives
to me his strength he gives
then fear anxiety will go
my heart with faith o’erflow
  
  
  
   
  

he is the shepherd true
his sheep he leadeth too
to pleasant pastures guideth me
to waters fresh and sweet
   
   
     
   

and when the sunlight fades
the darkness me o’ershades
i know that jesus through the night
will guard me with his might
   
   
    
   

yes if my faith should fail
the enemy prevail
then to the saviour’s heart i’ll flee
to find a remedy
   
 
    
   


now unto him i look
my burden to him take
oh jesus loves me tenderly
this will my comfort be

a kingly crown to gain
his blood-red banner streams afar
who follows in his train
    
    
  
    
   

who best can drink his cup of woe
triumphant over pain
who patient bears his cross below
he follows in his train
    
 
   
   

that martyr first whose eagle eye
could pierce beyond the grave
who saw his master in the sky
and called on him to save
    
  
   
   

like him with pardon on his tongue
in midst of mortal pain
he prayed for them that did the wrong
who follows in his train
  
  
    
   
a glorious band the chosen few
on whom the spirit came
twelve valiant saints their hope they
knew
and mocked the cross and flame
  
    
     
  


they climbed the steep ascent of heav’n
through peril toil and pain
o god to us may grace be given
to follow in their train
   
  
    
   


my lord has garments so wondrous fine
and myrrh their texture fills
its fragrance reached to this heart of mine
with joy my being thrills
 
   
  
    
    

out of the ivory palaces
into a world of woe
only his great eternal love
made my saviour go

   
    
    
  

his life had also its sorrows sore
for aloes had a part
and when i think of the cross he bore
my eyes with tear-drops start
   
   
    
   

out of the ivory palaces
into a world of woe
only his great eternal love
made my saviour go

   
    
    
  
his garments too were in cassia dipped
with healing in a touch
each time my feet in some sin
have slipped
he took me from its clutch
   
 
    
   

out of the ivory palaces
into a world of woe
only his great eternal love
made my saviour go

   
    
    
  

in garments glorious he will come
to open wide the door
and i shall enter my heav’nly home
to dwell forevermore
    
   
     
    


out of the ivory palaces
into a world of woe
only his great eternal love
made my saviour go

god sent his son
they called him jesus
he came to love heal and forgive
he lived and died to buy my pardon
an empty grave is there
to prove my saviour lives
god sent his son



because he lives i can face tomorrow
because he lives all fear is gone
because i know he holds my future
and life is worth the living
just because he lives


how sweet to hold a newborn baby
and feel the pride and joy he gives
but greater still the calm assurance
this child can face uncertain days
because he lives



because he lives i can face tomorrow
because he lives all fear is gone
because i know he holds my future
and life is worth the living
just because he lives


and then one day i’ll cross the river
i’ll fight life’s final war with pain
and then as death gives way to vict’ry
i’ll see the lights of glory
and i’ll know he reigns




because he lives i can face tomorrow
because he lives all fear is gone
because i know he holds my future
and life is worth the living
just because he lives

the first nol the angel did say
was to certain poor shepherds
in fields as they lay
in fields where they lay keeping their sheep
on a cold winter’s night that was so deep
   
   
   
   
    


nol nol nol nol
born is the king of israel

   
     

they lookd up and saw a star
shining in the east beyond them far
and to the earth it gave great light
and so it continued both day and night
   
   
    
    


nol nol nol nol
born is the king of israel

   
     

and by the light of that same star
three wise men came from country far
to seek for a king was their intent
and to follow the star wherever it went
   
  
  
     


nol nol nol nol
born is the king of israel

   
     

then did they know assuredly
within that house the king did lie
one entered it them for to see
and found the babe in poverty
     
    
     
  


nol nol nol nol
born is the king of israel

   
     

then entered in those wise men three
full reverently upon the knee
and offered there in his presence
their gold and myrrh and frankincense
    
   
  
     



nol nol nol nol
born is the king of israel

  when it’s all been said

lord your mercy is so great
that you look beyond our weakness
and find purest gold in miry clay
making sinners into saints

i will always sing your praise
here on earth and ever after
for you’ve shown me heaven’s
my true home
when it’s all been said and done
you’re my life when life is gone

there’s a call comes ringing
over the restless wave
“send the light send the light”
there are souls to rescue
there are souls to save
send the light send the light

let it shine from shore to shore

“send the light send the light”
and a golden offering at the cross we lay
send the light send the light
     
   
   
   

send the light the blessd gospel light
let it shine from shore to shore
send the light the blessd gospel light
let it shine forevermore

   
    
   
   

let us pray that grace
may everywhere abound
“send the light send the light”
and a christlike spirit everywhere be found
send the light send the light
   
   
    
   

send the light the blessd gospel light
let it shine from shore to shore
send the light the blessd gospel light
let it shine forevermore

   
    
   
   

let us not grow weary in the work of love
“send the light send the light”
let us gather jewels for a crown above
send the light send the light

that soon the “come” may be
naught but a gentle whisper
to one close close to thee
    
   
     
  

then over sea and mountain
far from or near my home
i’ll take thy hand and follow
at that sweet whisper “come”

you shine
brighter than the brightest star
your love
purer than the purest heart

you shine
filling us with courage and strength
to follow you

why should i fear man
when you made the heavens
why should i be afraid
when you put the stars in place
why should i lose heart
when i know how great you are
why should i give up
when your plans are full of love

in this world we will have trouble
but you have overcome the world



you shine
brighter than the brightest star
your love
purer than the purest heart

you are the stone
that the builders rejected
a rock of refuge
where my pride is broken

a sure foundation
when the sand is sinking
where we are built upon
like living stones
  you are the stone



there is no one else like you
there is no one like you lord
there is no one else like you
son of man and son of god
son of man and son of god

when from the cross
you to the depths descended
the host of hell conspired
to make you captive

but ev’ry chain of sin
and death you’ve broken
are triumphed over
by your mighty power



there is no one else like you
there is no one like you lord
there is no one else like you
son of man and son of god
son of man and son of god

i want to run
the race you’ve set before me
even to share
in the suff’ring of the cross
that i might gain
the prize for which you called me
to be with you son of man
and son of god
to be with you son of man
and son of god

then from the earth
you to the heights ascended
where you are seated
at your father’s right hand

forever pleading
for the souls you’ve captured
forever watching
as you call us home



there is no one else like you
there is no one like you lord
there is no one else like you
son of man and son of god
son of man and son of god
son of man and son of god


brightly beams our father’s mercy
from his lighthouse evermore
but to us he gives the keeping
of the lights along the shore
    
    
  
    
  

let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
for to us he gives the keeping
of the lights along the shore

     
   
  
   

dark the night of sin has settled
loud the angry billows roar
eager eyes are watching longing
for the lights along the shore
    
   
  
    

let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
eager eyes are watching longing
for the lights along the shore

     
   
  
   

trim your feeble lamp my brother
some poor sailor tempest tossed
trying now to make the harbour
in the darkness may be lost
   
   
   
  


let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
trying now to make the harbour
some poor sailor may be lost

dear lord and father of mankind
forgive our foolish ways
reclothe us in our rightful mind
in purer lives thy service find
in deeper reverence praise
   
   
   
    
   
  

in simple trust like theirs who heard
beside the syrian sea
the gracious calling of the lord
let us like them without a word
rise up and follow thee
     
  
    
    
   

drop thy still dews of quietness
till all our strivings cease
take from our souls the strain and stress
and let our ordered lives confess
the beauty of thy peace
  
   
   
    
   

breathe through the heats of our desire
thy coolness and thy balm
let sense be dumb let flesh retire
speak through the earthquake wind
and fire
o still small voice of calm
  
 
   
    
   


you are most worthy o lord our god
you are most worthy o lord our god
you are most worthy o lord our god

thy holy spirit lord alone
can turn our hearts from sin
his power alone can sanctify
and keep us pure within
   
    
  
     
   

thy holy spirit lord alone
can deeper love inspire
his power alone within our souls
can light the sacred fire
     
 
    
   

thy holy spirit lord can bring
the gifts we seek in prayer
his voice can words of comfort speak
and still each wave of care
    
   
   
  


thy holy spirit lord can give
the grace we need this hour
and while we wait o spirit come
in sanctifying power
    
 
     
  


in a mock purple arrayed
with thorns piercing thy brow
with hands bound taken out of the city
   
   
  e
   

thy face showing the suff’ring
which thou didst allow
also for your tormentorswhat pity

  
  
     


but thy suff’ring transcends
the mere physical lord
although thou art in dire situation
    
 
   

greater far is the
spiritual suff’ring endured
knowing they would reject thy salvation

    
 
     


thy compassion o lord
reaches out to thy foes
thy heart for them is o’erfilling
  
 
    

they do not understand
to thee their hearts are closed
but thy prophecy they are fulfilling

   
 
     


“bring the sceptre to him
on your knees everyone
live forever o king”moods
are wors’ning
  
   
   


and now into thy hand
o thou god’s only son
they the reed of bulrushes are forcing

   
  
  


with the reeds they beat down
on the sharp thorny crown
and slaps on thy gaunt cheeks
follow after
  
  
    

and the blood from thy forehead
is now trickling down
all the more they are engulfed with
laughter
   
   
    

   
 
    

    
  
     



yield not to temptation
for yielding is sin
each vict’ry will help you
some other to win
   
   
   
 
 

fight manfully onward
dark passions subdue
look ever to jesus
he will carry you through
  
   
   
  

ask the saviour to help you
comfort strengthen and keep you
he is willing to aid you
he will carry you through

   
   
   
  

shun evil companions
bad language disdain
god’s name hold in rev’rence
nor take it in vain
   
   
  
 

be thoughtful and earnest
kind-hearted and true
look ever to jesus
he will carry you through
  
   
   
  

ask the saviour to help you
comfort strengthen and keep you
he is willing to aid you
he will carry you through

   
   
   
  

to him to o’ercometh
god giveth a crown
thro’ faith we shall conquer
though often cast down
  
 
  
  

he who is our saviour
our strength will renew
look ever to jesus
he will carry you through
  
 
   
  


ask the saviour to help you
comfort strengthen and keep you
he is willing to aid you
he will carry you through

   
   
   
  


brightest and best of the sons of the morning
dawn on our darkness and lend us thine aid
star of the east the horizon adorning
guide where our infant redeemer is laid
  
     
    
     
    

cold on his cradle the dewdrops are shining
low lies his head with the beasts of the stall
angels adore him in slumber reclining
maker and monarch and saviour of all
    
    
     
    

say shall we yield him in costly devotion
odours of edom and offerings divine
gems of the mountain and pearls of the ocean
myrrh from the forest or gold from the mine
      
   
   
      

vainly we offer each ample oblation
vainly with gifts would his favour secure
richer by far is the heart’s adoration
dearer to god are the prayers of the poor
    
    
    
    


brightest and best of the sons of the morning

there is a gate that stands ajar
and through its portals gleaming
a radiance from the cross afar
the saviour’s love revealing
   
    
   
  
    

o depth of mercy can it be
that gate was left ajar for me
for me for me for me for me
was left ajar for me

   
   
   
  

that gate ajar stands free for all
who seek through it salvation
the rich and poor the great and small
of every tribe and nation
    
    
   
  

o depth of mercy can it be
that gate was left ajar for me
for me for me for me for me
was left ajar for me

   
   
   
  
press onward then though foes may
frown
while mercy’s gate is open
accept the cross and win the crown
love’s everlasting token
     
  
    
  

o depth of mercy can it be
that gate was left ajar for me
for me for me for me for me
was left ajar for me

   
   
   
  

beyond the river’s brink we’ll lay
the cross that here is given
and bear the crown of life away
and love him more in heaven
    
    
  
  


o depth of mercy can it be
that gate was left ajar for me
for me for me for me for me
was left ajar for me

thou from hence my all shalt be
     
     
   
   
    

perish every fond ambition
all i’ve sought and hoped and known
yet how rich is my condition
god and heav’n are still my own
   
   
   
     

let the world despise and leave me
they have left my saviour too
human hearts and looks deceive me
thou art not like man untrue
    
    
   
    

and while thou shalt smile upon me
god of wisdom love and might
foes may hate and friends may shun me
show thy face and all is bright
   
     
   
    

man may trouble and distress me
’twill but drive me to thy breast
life with trials hard may press me
heaven will bring me sweeter rest
   
    
  
  

oh ’tis not in grief to harm me
while thy love is left to me
oh ’twere not in joy to charm me
were that joy unmixed with thee
   
    
   
    

hasten on from grace to glory
armed by faith and winged by prayer
heav’n’s eternal days before me
god’s own hand shall guide me there
  
  
  
   


soon shall close my earthly mission
swift shall pass my pilgrim days
hope shall change to glad fruition
faith to sight and prayer to praise

the weary find eternal rest
and all the sons of want are blest

’neath the stars of the night
walked the saviour of light
in the garden of dew-ladened breeze
 
 
   
     

where no light could be found
jesus knelt on the ground
there he prayed ’neath the old
olive trees
   
  
    

’neath the old olive trees
’neath the old olive trees
went the saviour alone on his knees

  
  
   

“not my will thine be done”
cried the father’s own son
as he knelt ’neath the old olive trees
  
  
    

all the sins of the world
on the saviour was hurled
as he knelt in the garden alone
  
   
    

hear his soul-burdened plea
“let this cup pass from me
even so not my will thine be done”
  
  
     

’neath the old olive trees
’neath the old olive trees
went the saviour alone on his knees

  
  
   

“not my will thine be done”
cried the father’s own son
as he knelt ’neath the old olive trees
  
  
    

may my song ever be
of the love proffered me
by my lord all alone on his knees
   
   
    

praise his wonderful name
he who bore all my blame
as he knelt ’neath the old olive trees
    
    
    

’neath the old olive trees
’neath the old olive trees
went the saviour alone on his knees

  
  
   


“not my will thine be done”
cried the father’s own son
as he knelt ’neath the old olive trees

how deep the father’s love for us
how vast beyond all measure
that he should give his only son
to make a wretch his treasure

how great the pain of searing loss
the father turns his face away
as wounds which mar the chosen one
bring many sons to glory
how deep the father’s love

behold the man upon a cross
my sin upon his shoulders
ashamed i hear my mocking voice
call out among the scoffers

it was my sin that held him there
until it was accomplished
his dying breath has brought me life
i know that it is finished


i will not boast in anything
no gifts no pow’r no wisdom
but i will boast in jesus christ
his death and resurrection

why should i gain from his reward
i cannot give an answer
but this i know with all my heart
his wounds have paid my ransom


be not dismayed whate’er betide
god will take care of you
beneath his wings of love abide
god will take care of you
    
    
   
    
  

god will take care of you
thro’ every day o’er all the way
he will take care of you
god will take care of you

   
     
  
   

thro’ days of toil when heart doth fail
god will take care of you
when dangers fierce your path assail
god will take care of you
   
   
   
  

god will take care of you
thro’ every day o’er all the way
he will take care of you
god will take care of you

   
     
  
   

all you may need he will provide
god will take care of you
nothing you ask will be denied
god will take care of you
   
   
    
  

god will take care of you
thro’ every day o’er all the way
he will take care of you
god will take care of you

   
     
  
   

no matter what may be the test
god will take care of you
lean weary one upon his breast
god will take care of you
    
   
    
  


god will take care of you
thro’ every day o’er all the way
he will take care of you
god will take care of you

o sometimes the shadows are deep
and rough seems the path to the goal
and sorrows sometimes how the sweep
like tempests down over the soul

  
  
   
    
    

o then to the rock let me fly
to the rock that is higher than i
o then to the rock let me fly
to the rock that is higher than i

    
    
    
   

o sometimes how long seems the day
and sometimes how weary my feet
but toiling in life’s dusty way
the rock’s blessed shadow how sweet
   
    
    
  

o then to the rock let me fly
to the rock that is higher than i
o then to the rock let me fly
to the rock that is higher than i

    
    
    
   

o near to the rock let me keep
if blessings or sorrows prevail
or climbing the mountain way steep
or walking the shadowy vale
    
    
    
    


o then to the rock let me fly
to the rock that is higher than i
o then to the rock let me fly
to the rock that is higher than i

i hear the saviour say
“thy strength indeed is small
child of weakness watch and pray
find in me thine all in all”
 
 
    
   
    

jesus paid it all
all to him i owe
sin had left a crimson stain
he washed it white as snow

  
 
   
   

lord now indeed i find
thy power and thine alone
can change the leper’s spots
and melt the heart of stone
  
  
  
   

jesus paid it all
all to him i owe
sin had left a crimson stain
he washed it white as snow

  
 
   
   

for nothing good have i
whereby thy grace to claim
i’ll wash my garments white
in the blood of calvary’s lamb
   
   
     
   

jesus paid it all
all to him i owe
sin had left a crimson stain
he washed it white as snow

  
 
   
   

and when before the throne
i stand in him complete
“jesus died my soul to save”
my lips shall still repeat
    
   
  
   


jesus paid it all
all to him i owe
sin had left a crimson stain
he washed it white as snow

  
 
   
   


where he may lead me i will go
for i have learned to trust him so
and i remember ’twas for me
that he was slain on calvary
     
     
    
    
   

jesus shall lead me night and day
jesus shall lead me all the way
he is the truest friend to me
for i remember calvary
 


     
   
    
   

o i delight in his command
love to be led by his dear hand
his divine will is sweet to me
hallowed by blood-stained calvary
   
    
    
   

jesus shall lead me night and day
jesus shall lead me all the way
he is the truest friend to me
for i remember calvary
 


     
   
    
   

onward i go nor doubt nor fear
happy with christ my saviour near
trusting some day that i shall see
jesus my friend of calvary
    
   
     
   


jesus shall lead me night and day
jesus shall lead me all the way
he is the truest friend to me
for i remember calvary

i’ve seen the lightning flashing
i’ve heard the thunder roll
i’ve felt sin’s breakers dashing
which almost conquered my soul
  
  
  
   
    

i’ve heard the voice of my saviour
bidding me still to fight on
he promised never to leave me
never to leave me alone
   
  
   
    

no never alone
no never alone
he promised never to leave me
he’ll claim me for his own

   
   
   
   

no never alone
no never alone
he promised never to leave me
never to leave me alone
   
   
   
   

the world’s fierce winds are blowing
temptation sharp and keen
i have a peace in knowing
my saviour stands between
   
  
  
   

he stands to shield me from danger
when my friends are all gone
he promised never to leave me
never to leave me alone
  
   
  
    

no never alone
no never alone
he promised never to leave me
he’ll claim me for his own

   
   
   
   

no never alone
no never alone
he promised never to leave me
never to leave me alone
   
   
   
   

when in affliction’s valley
i tread the road of care
my saviour helps me carry
the cross so heavy to bear
    
   
    
  

though all around me is darkness
earthly joys all flown
my saviour whispers his promise
never to leave me alone
   
   
   
    

no never alone
no never alone
he promised never to leave me
he’ll claim me for his own

   
   
   
   

no never alone
no never alone
he promised never to leave me
never to leave me alone
   
   
   
   

he died on calvary’s mountain
for me they piercd his side
for me he opened that fountain
the crimson cleansing tide
   
   
  
   

for me he waiteth in glory
seated upon his throne
he promised never to leave me
never to leave me alone
   
  
    
    

no never alone
no never alone
he promised never to leave me
he’ll claim me for his own

   
   
   
   


no never alone
no never alone
he promised never to leave me
never to leave me alone

what can take a dying man
and raise him up to life again
what can heal a wounded soul
what can make us white as snow

what can fill the emptiness
what can mend our brokenness
brokenness
  what can take a dying man



mighty awesome wonderful
is the holy cross
where the lamb laid down his life
to lift us from the fall
mighty is the power of the cross

what restores our faith in god
what reveals the father’s love
what can lead the wayward home
what can melt a heart of stone

what can free the guilty ones
what can save and overcome
overcome



mighty awesome wonderful
is the holy cross
where the lamb laid down his life
to lift us from the fall
mighty is the power of the cross


it’s a miracle to me
it’s a miracle to me
and it’s still a mystery
and it’s still a mystery

it’s a miracle to me
the power of god
for those who believe




mighty awesome wonderful
is the holy cross
where the lamb laid down his life
to lift us from the fall
mighty is the power of the cross

on its wide heaving sea
thou blest “rock of ages”

how oft in the conflict
when pressed by the foe
i have fled to my refuge
and breathed out my woe
   
  
   
    

how often when trials
like sea billows roll
have i hidden in thee
o thou rock of my soul

precious moments we share
hearts rejoicing as we
congregate in the name of our lord
   
 
  
   

jesus promised that he
present with us would be
let our hearts beat with his in accord
  
   
    

oh how pleasant it is
in his presence to meet
shutting out the world’s tumult and din
   
   
   

how rewarding it is
just to sit at his feet
and receive untold blessings from him
  
 
  

travel-weary we come
to this haven of rest
to relax where god’s waters still flow
  
 
   

then renewed and restored
by his spirit refreshed
on our way with rejoicing we’ll go
  
  
   

in a fellowship blessed
our hearts have been bound
and by manna from heaven been fed
   
  
   

in god’s wonderful book
daily bread we have found
and new strength for the pathway ahead
  
  
    

in a close-knit communion
with christ as our head
and endued with god’s power from high
 
 
    


on the pathway of life
we by him will be led
knowing god all our needs will supply

flowed the sin-cleansing blood
if his dying thy debt has not paid
  
   
    

look look look and live
there is life for a look
at the crucified one

thy weight of iniquities roll
   
  
     

look look look and live

at the crucified one

since god has declared

of the world he appeared
and completed the work he begun

on the cross for your sins he did pay
everlasting salvation he gave you

don’t complain at the load you must bear
and at times when hard trials befall you
rest assured you are under his care

to protect us he ever is near

and our craft into port he will steer
     
    
      
    
    
    
      
      
    
    
    
     

we hard trials are still undergoing
but soon life’s final battle will come
we will finish our course fully knowing
that we’re off to our heavenly home

there we’ll have peace and quietfor never
a disturbance or storm will be there
christ our saviour will reign there forever
and his glory and splendour we’ll share

o sacred head now wounded
with grief and shame weighed down
now scornfully surrounded
with thorns thine only crown
  
  
   
 
   

how pale thou art with anguish
with sore abuse and scorn
how does that visage languish
which once was bright as morn
    
  
    
   

what thou my lord hast suffered
was all for sinners’ gain
mine mine was the transgression
but thine the deadly pain
   
  
  
 

lo here i fall my saviour
’tis i deserve thy place
look on me with thy favour
vouchsafe to me thy grace
   
 
  
  

my burden in thy passion
lord thou hast borne for me
for it was my transgression
which brought this woe on thee
   
    
  
  

i cast me down before thee
wrath were my rightful lot
have mercy i implore thee
redeemer spurn me not
  
   
  
   

what language shall i borrow
to thank thee dearest friend
for this thy dying sorrow
thy pity without end
     
   
   
    

o make me thine forever
and should i fainting be
lord let me never never
outlive my love to thee
  
 
  
  

my shepherd now receive me
my guardian own me thine
great blessings thou didst give me
o source of gifts divine
  
   
    
  


thy lips have often fed me
with words of truth and love
thy spirit oft hath led me
to heavenly joys above
     
  
  
 


now thank we all our god
with heart and hands and voices
who wondrous things hath done
in whom this world rejoices
    
  
   
  
     

who from our mothers’ arms
hath blessed us on our way
with countless gifts of love
and still is ours today
   
   
  
 

o may this bounteous god
through all our life be near us
with ever joyful hearts
and blessed peace to cheer us
    
 
   
   

and keep us in his grace
and guide us when perplexed
and free us from all ills
in this world and the next
   
  
   
  

all praise and thanks to god
the father now be given
the son and him who reigns
with them in highest heaven
   
  
   
    


the one eternal god
whom earth and heav’n adore
for thus it was is now
and shall be evermore
   
  
     
    


i will sing unto the lord as long as i live
i will sing praise to my god
while i have my being
my meditation of him shall be sweet
i will be glad i will rejoice in the lord
     

      
      
    
    


bless the lord o my soul
praise thou the lord
 
 

i must needs go home by the way of
the cross
there’s no other way but this
i shall ne’er get sight of the gates of light
if the way of the cross i miss
   
     
  
   
     
    

the way of the cross leads home
the way of the cross leads home
it is sweet to know as i onward go
the way of the cross leads home

   
   
     
   
i must needs go on in the blood-
sprinkled way
the path that the saviour trod
if i ever climb to the heights sublime
where the soul is at home with god
     
   
    

   

the way of the cross leads home
the way of the cross leads home
it is sweet to know as i onward go
the way of the cross leads home

   
   
     
   
then i bid farewell to the way of the world
to walk in it never more
for my lord says “come” and i seek
my home
where he waits at the open door
    
 
   
     
     


the way of the cross leads home
the way of the cross leads home
it is sweet to know as i onward go
the way of the cross leads home

i’m pressing on the upward way
new heights i’m gaining every day
still praying as i’m onward bound
“lord plant my feet on higher ground”
 
   
    
    
    

lord lift me up and let me stand
by faith on heaven’s tableland
a higher plain than i have found
lord plant my feet on higher ground

   
     
    
   
my heart has no desire to stay
where doubts arise and fears dismay
though some may dwell where these
abound
my prayer my aim is higher ground
    
    
     
    

lord lift me up and let me stand
by faith on heaven’s tableland
a higher plain than i have found
lord plant my feet on higher ground

   
     
    
   

i want to live above the world
though satan’s darts at me are hurled
for faith has caught the joyful sound
the song of saints on higher ground
    
   
    
    

lord lift me up and let me stand
by faith on heaven’s tableland
a higher plain than i have found
lord plant my feet on higher ground

   
     
    
   

i want to scale the utmost height
and catch a gleam of glory bright
but still i’ll pray ’til heaven i’ve found
“lord lead me on to higher ground”
   
  
   
   


lord lift me up and let me stand
by faith on heaven’s tableland
a higher plain than i have found

swift and beautiful for thee
take my voice and let me sing
always only for my king

take my lips and let them be
filled with messages for thee
take my silver and my gold
not a mite would i withhold
not a mite would i withhold

at thy feet its treasure store
take myself and i will be
ever only all for thee

blessd be the fountain of blood
to a world of sinners revealed
blessd be the dear son of god
only by his stripes we are healed
   
    
   
   
   

tho’ i’ve wandered far from his fold
bringing to my heart pain and woe
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow
    
    
  
    

whiter than the snow
whiter than the snow
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow

   
  
    

thorny was the crown that he wore
and the cross his body o’ercame
grievous were the sorrows he bore
but he suffered thus not in vain
   
     
   
    

may i to that fountain be led
made to cleanse my sins here below
wash me in the blood that he shed
and i shall be whiter than snow
    
    
  
    

whiter than the snow
whiter than the snow
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow

   
  
    

father i have wandered from thee
often has my heart gone astray
crimson do my sins seem to me
water cannot wash them away
   
    
    
     

jesus to the fountain of thine
leaning on thy promise i go
cleanse me by thy washing divine
and i shall be whiter than snow
     
    
  
    


whiter than the snow
whiter than the snow
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow

o church arise and put your armour on
hear the call of christ our captain
for now the weak can say that they
are strong
in the strength that god has given

with shield of faith and belt of truth
we’ll stand against the devil’s lies
an army bold whose battle-cry is love
reaching out to those in darkness
  o church arise
our call to war to love the captive soul
but to rage against the captor
and with the sword that makes
the wounded whole
we will fight with faith and valour

when faced with trials on ev’ry side
we know the outcome is secure
and christ will have the prize
for which he died
an inheritance of nations
come see the cross where love and
mercy meet
as the son of god is stricken
then see his foes lie crushed beneath
his feet
for the conqueror has risen

and as the stone is rolled away
and christ emerges from the grave
this vict’ry march continues till the day
ev’ry eye and heart shall see him

so spirit come put strength in
ev’ry stride
give grace for ev’ry hurdle
that we may run with faith to win the prize
of a servant good and faithful

as saints of old still line the way
retelling triumphs of his grace
we hear their calls and hunger for the day
when with christ we stand in glory


just let me say
how much you love me
let me speak
of your mercy and grace

that lets me live
in the shadow of your beauty
so i may see
you face to face
a  just let me say revised

for the earth should shake
as your word goes forth
and the heavens
should tremble and fall

yet these words
just say you love me
oh my saviour
my lord and friend

just let me hear
your finest whispers
as you gently
call my name

and let me see
your power and your glory
let me feel
your spirit’s flame

for you have found me
in my desert
and this sand
is holy ground

and my brokenness
is mended
by you
my lord and friend

so let me say
how much you love me
as all my hope
is found in you

and i am caught
in this passion of knowing
this endless love
i have in you


for the depths of grace
the forgiveness found
to be called
a child of god

just makes me say
how much i love you
oh my saviour
my lord and friend


jesus all for jesus
all i am and have
and ever hope to be


all of my ambitions hopes and plans
i surrender these
into your hands

jesus all for jesus



for it’s only in
your will that i am free
for it’s only in
your will that i am free

jesus all for jesus
all i am and have
and ever hope to be


my hope is built on nothing less
than jesus’ blood and righteousness
i dare not trust the sweetest frame
but wholly lean on jesus’ name
   
   
   
   
   

on christ the solid rock i stand
all other ground is sinking sand
all other ground is sinking sand

    
    
    

when darkness seems to hide his face
i rest on his unchanging grace
in every high and stormy gale
my anchor holds within the veil
    
  
    
   

on christ the solid rock i stand
all other ground is sinking sand
all other ground is sinking sand

    
    
    

his oath his covenant his blood
support me in the whelming flood
when all around my soul gives way
he then is all my hope and stay
   
    
   
    

on christ the solid rock i stand
all other ground is sinking sand
all other ground is sinking sand

    
    
    

when he shall come with trumpet sound
o may i then in him be found
dressed in his righteousness alone
faultless to stand before the throne
     
    
   
     


on christ the solid rock i stand
all other ground is sinking sand
all other ground is sinking sand

but when i am happy with him
december december december
december is as pleasant as may
   
     
   
     
     

his name yields the richest perfume
and sweeter than music his voice

and makes all and makes all and makes all
and makes all within me rejoice

once in royal david’s city
stood a lowly cattle shed
where a mother laid her baby
in a manger for his bed
mary was that mother mild
jesus christ her little child
once in royal david’s city


he came down to earth from heaven
who is god and lord of all
and his shelter was a stable
and his cradle was a stall
with the poor and meek and lowly
lived on earth our saviour holy


and through all his wondrous childhood
day by day like us he grew
he was little weak and helpless
tears and smiles like us he knew
and he feeleth for our sadness
and he shareth in our gladness


still among the poor and lowly
hope in christ is brought to birth
with the promise of salvation
for the nations of the earth
still in him our life is found
and our hope of heav’n is crowned


and our eyes at last shall see him
through his own redeeming love
for that child so dear and gentle
is our lord in heav’n above
and he leads his children on
to the place where he is gone



not in that poor lowly stable
with the oxen standing by
we shall see him but in heaven
set at god’s right hand on high
when like stars his children crowned
all in white shall wait around


true-hearted whole-hearted faithful and loyal
king of our lives by thy grace we will be
under the standard exalted and royal
strong in thy strength we will battle for thee
 
   
    
    
   

peal out the watchword silence it never
song of our spirits rejoicing and free
peal out the watchword loyal forever
king of our lives by thy grace we will be

   
    
     
     

true-hearted whole-hearted fullest allegiance
yielding henceforth to our glorious king
valiant endeavour and loving obedience
freely and joyously now would we bring
   
    
    
     

peal out the watchword silence it never
song of our spirits rejoicing and free
peal out the watchword loyal forever
king of our lives by thy grace we will be

   
    
     
     

true-hearted whole-hearted saviour
all-glorious
take thy great power and reign there alone
over our wills and affections victorious
freely surrendered and wholly thine own
   
    
    
    


peal out the watchword silence it never
song of our spirits rejoicing and free
peal out the watchword loyal forever
king of our lives by thy grace we will be

   
    
     
     


my faith looks up to thee
thou lamb of calvary
saviour divine
   
   
  
 

now hear me while i pray
take all my guilt away
oh let me from this day
be wholly thine
  
 
   
  

may thy rich grace impart
strength to my fainting heart
my zeal inspire
  
    
   

as thou hast died for me
oh may my love to thee
pure warm and changeless be
a living fire
    
   
   
 

while life’s dark maze i tread
and griefs around me spread
be thou my guide
   
   
 

bid darkness turn to day
wipe sorrow’s tears away
nor let me ever stray
from thee aside
   
 
   
  

when ends life’s transient dream
when death’s cold sullen stream
shall o’er me roll
   
  
 


blest saviour then in love
fear and distrust remove
oh bear me safe above
a ransomed soul
  
    
    
  


jesus lover of my soul
all consuming fire is in your gaze
jesus i want you to know
i will follow you all my days

for no one else in history is like you
and history itself belongs to you
alpha and omega you have loved me
and i will share eternity with you
jesus lover of my soul



it’s all about you jesus
and all this is for you
for your glory and your fame
it’s not about me
as if you should do things my way
you alone are god
and i surrender to your ways


for the beauty of the earth
for the glory of the skies
for the love which from our birth
over and around us lies

king of kings and lord of lords
king of kings and lord of lords

there is none like you
no one else can touch my heart
like you do
i could search for all eternity long
and find there is none like you
there is none like you



your mercy flows like a river wide
and healing comes from your hands
suffering children are safe
in your arms
there is none like you




there is none like you
no one else can touch my heart
like you do
i could search for all eternity long
and find there is none like you
repeat


now the day is over
night is drawing nigh
shadows of the evening
steal across the sky
 
  
  
 
  

jesus give the weary
calm and sweet repose
with thy tenderest blessing
may mine eyelids close
 
  
  
 

grant to little children
visions bright of thee
guard the sailors tossing
on the deep blue sea
 
 
  
  

through the long night watches
may thine angels spread
their white wings above me
watching round my bed
 
    
 
  


when the morning wakens
then may i arise
pure and fresh and sinless
in thy holy eyes
   
  
   
  




fear not for i am with you
fear not for i am with you
fear not for i am with you
says the lord
fear not

i have redeemed you
i’ve called you by name
child you are mine
when you walk through the waters
i’ll be there
and through the flame

you’ll not no way be burnt
you’ll not no way be drowned
for i am with you
fear not

joy has dawned upon the world
promised from creation
god’s salvation now unfurled
hope for ev’ry nation

not with fanfares from above
not with scenes of glory
but a humble gift of love
jesus born of mary
  joy has dawned

sounds of wonder fill the sky
with the songs of angels
as the mighty prince of life
shelters in a stable

hands that set each star in place
shaped the earth in darkness
cling now to a mother’s breast
vulnerable and helpless

shepherds bow before the lamb
gazing at the glory
gifts of men from distant lands
prophesy the story

gold a king is born today
incense god is with us
myrrh his death will make a way
and by his blood he’ll win us


son of adam son of heav’n
given as a ransom
reconciling god and man
christ our mighty champion

what a saviour what a friend
what a glorious mystery
once a babe in bethlehem
now the lord of history


like a waterfall
is to one drop of rain
like a mountain tow’rs
above a single grain of sand

like the blazing sun
is to a candle flame
like a thousand years to one day

  like a waterfall
beyond sight beyond mind
beyond sense space and time
most beautiful mystery of all


you are god above
angels worship you
most beautiful mystery
three times holy god
god whose name is love
most beautiful mystery
you stride among the stars
you call them each by name
to you the galaxies
are only dust upon the scales

before the world was formed
not even day or night
and all the angels sang
with pure delight
you were there and we were not
beyond sight beyond mind
beyond sense space and time
most beautiful mystery of all


you are god above
angels worship you
most beautiful mystery
three times holy god
god whose name is love
most beautiful mystery


you are god my god
you are most beautiful mystery


you are god above
angels worship you
most beautiful mystery
three times holy god
god whose name is love
most beautiful mystery

so wise a counsellor and guide
so mighty a defender
   
  
   
   


from him who loves me now so well
what power my soul can sever
shall life or death shall earth or hell
no i am his forever
  
    
      
   


when i see the beauty
of a sunset’s glory
amazing artistry
across the evening sky

when i feel the mystery
of a distant galaxy
it awes and humbles me
to be loved by a god so high
  when i see the beauty


what can i do but thank you
what can i do but give my life to you
hallelujah hallelujah
what can i do but praise you
every day make ev’rything i do
a hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah

when i hear the story
of a god of mercy
who shared humanity
and suffered by our side

of the cross they nailed you to
that could not hold you
now you’re making all things new
by the pow’r of your risen life



what can i do but thank you
what can i do but give my life to you
hallelujah hallelujah
what can i do but praise you
every day make ev’rything i do
a hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
repeat

o for a faith that will not shrink
tho’ pressed by ev’ry foe
that will not tremble on the brink
of any earthly woe
    
    
  
    
   

that will not murmur nor complain
beneath the chastening rod
but in the hour of grief or pain
will lean upon its god
     
  
  
   

a faith that shines more bright and clear
when tempests rage without
that when in danger knows no fear
in darkness feels no doubt
   
   
     
  


lord give us such a faith as this
and then whate’er may come
we’ll taste e’en here the hallowed bliss
of an eternal home
    
    
   
  



god is good all the time
he put a song of praise
in this heart of mine
god is good all the time
through the darkest night
his light will shine
god is good god is good
all the time
god is good all the time
if you’re walking
through the valley
and there are shadows all around
do not fear
he will guide you
he will keep you safe and sound
’cause he has promised
to never leave you
nor forsake you
and his word is true

god is good all the time
he put a song of praise
in this heart of mine
god is good all the time
through the darkest night
his light will shine
god is good god is good
all the time
we were sinners
so unworthy
still for us he chose to die
filled us with
his holy spirit
now we can stand and testify
that his love
is everlasting
and his mercies
they will never end

god is good all the time
he put a song of praise
in this heart of mine
god is good all the time
through the darkest night
his light will shine
god is good god is good
all the time



though i may not understand
all the plans you have for me
my life is in your hands
and through the eyes of faith
i can clearly see


god is good all the time
he put a song of praise
in this heart of mine
god is good all the time
through the darkest night
his light will shine
god is good god is good
god is good he’s so good
god is good he’s so good
all the time


it may not be on the mountain’s height
or over the stormy sea
it may not be at the battle’s front
my lord will have need of me
    
     
     
      
   
but if by a still small voice he calls
to paths i do not know
i’ll answer dear lord with my hand
in yours
i’ll go where you want me to go
    
   
    
    

i’ll go where you want me to go dear lord
o’er mountain or plain or sea
i’ll say what you want me to say dear lord
i’ll be what you want me to be

     
   
      
     

perhaps today there are loving words
which jesus would have me speak
there may be now in the paths of sin
some wand’rer whom i should seek
    
   
    
   

o saviour if you will be my guide
though dark and rugged the way
my voice shall echo the message sweet
i’ll say what you want me to say
    
    
      
     

i’ll go where you want me to go dear lord
o’er mountain or plain or sea
i’ll say what you want me to say dear lord
i’ll be what you want me to be

     
   
      
     

there’s surely somewhere a lowly place
in earth’s harvest fields so wide
where i may labour through life’s short day
for jesus the crucified
    
  
     
  

so trusting my all unto your care
i know you always love me
i’ll do your will with a heart sincere
i’ll be what you want me to be
   
   
     
     


i’ll go where you want me to go dear lord
o’er mountain or plain or sea
i’ll say what you want me to say dear lord
i’ll be what you want me to be

     
   
      
     


i will sing of my redeemer
and his wondrous love to me
on the cruel cross he suffered
from the curse to set me free
   
   
   
   
  

sing oh sing of my redeemer
with his blood he purchased me
on the cross he sealed my pardon
paid the debt and made me free

    
   
    
    

i will tell the wondrous story
how my lost estate to save
in his boundless love and mercy
he the ransom freely gave
  
    
    
   

sing oh sing of my redeemer
with his blood he purchased me
on the cross he sealed my pardon
paid the debt and made me free

    
   
    
    

i will praise my dear redeemer
his triumphant power i’ll tell
how the victory he giveth
over sin and death and hell
   
  
   
    

sing oh sing of my redeemer
with his blood he purchased me
on the cross he sealed my pardon
paid the debt and made me free

    
   
    
    

i will sing of my redeemer
and his heav’nly love to me
he from death to life hath brought me
son of god with him to be
   
  
    
    


sing oh sing of my redeemer
with his blood he purchased me
on the cross he sealed my pardon
paid the debt and made me free

    
   
    
    


brightly beams our father’s mercy
from his lighthouse evermore
but to us he gives the keeping
of the lights along the shore
-      
    
   ―
    
 

let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
for to us he gives the keeping
of the lights along the shore

    
   
   
   

dark the night of sin has settled
loud the angry billows roar
eager eyes are watching longing
for the lights along the shore
    
  
  
  

let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
eager eyes are watching longing
for the lights along the shore

    
   
   
   

trim your feeble lamp my brother
some poor sailor tempest tossed
trying now to make the harbour
in the darkness may be lost
    
  
    
’     


let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
trying now to make the harbour
some poor sailor may be lost

    
   
   
   


who is on the lord’s side
who will serve the king
who will be his helpers
other lives to bring

who will leave the world’s side
who will face the foe
who is on the lord’s side
who for him will go
  
 
   
  

by thy call of mercy
by thy grace divine
we are on the lord’s side
saviour we are thine
  
   
  
  

not for weight of glory
not for crown and palm
enter we the army

but for love that claimeth
lives for whom he died
he whom jesus nameth
must be on his side
    
   
 
 

by thy love constraining
by thy grace divine
we are on the lord’s side
saviour we are thine
 
   
  
  

jesus thou hast bought us
not with gold or gem
but with thine own life-blood
for thy diadem
  
   
 
  

with thy blessing filling
each who comes to thee
thou hast made us willing
thou hast made us free
 
   
  
 

by thy grand redemption
by thy grace divine
we are on the lord’s side
saviour we are thine
 
   
  
  

fierce may be the conflict
strong may be the foe
but the king’s own army
none can overthrow
   
  
  
  

’round his standard ranging
victory to secure
for his truth unchanging
makes the triumph sure
  
  
    
 


joyfully enlisting
by thy grace divine
we are on the lord’s side
saviour we are thine

one sat alone beside the highway begging
his eyes were blind the light he could not see
he clutched his rags and shivered in the
shadows
then jesus came and bade his darkness flee
 
    
       
     
      

when jesus comes the tempter’s power is
broken
when jesus comes the tears are wiped away
he takes the gloom and fills the life with glory
for all is changed when jesus comes to stay

      
    
    
      

from home and friends the evil spirits
drove him
among the tombs he dwelt in misery
he cut himself as demon powers possessed him
then jesus came and set the captive free
     
    
     
     

when jesus comes the tempter’s power is
broken
when jesus comes the tears are wiped away
he takes the gloom and fills the life with glory
for all is changed when jesus comes to stay

      
    
    
      

“unclean unclean” the leper cried in torment
the deaf the dumb in helplessness stood near
the fever raged disease had gripped its victim
then jesus came and cast out every fear 
    

     
      
     

when jesus comes the tempter’s power is
broken
when jesus comes the tears are wiped away
he takes the gloom and fills the life with glory
for all is changed when jesus comes to stay

      
    
    
      

their hearts were sad as in the tomb they
laid him
for death had come and taken him away
their night was dark and bitter tears were falling
then jesus came and night was turned to day
       

       
    
      

when jesus comes the tempter’s power is
broken
when jesus comes the tears are wiped away
he takes the gloom and fills the life with glory
for all is changed when jesus comes to stay

      
    
    
      

so men today have found the saviour able
they could not conquer passion lust and sin
their broken hearts had left them sad and
lonely
then jesus came and dwelt himself within 
      
      
      
      


when jesus comes the tempter’s power is
broken
when jesus comes the tears are wiped away
he takes the gloom and fills the life with glory
for all is changed when jesus comes to stay

      
    
    
      


to god be the glory
to god be the glory
to god be the glory
for the things he has done
    
 
 
 
    


by his blood he has saved me
by his power he has raised me
to god be the glory
for the things he has done
   
   
 
    



god’s not dead no he is alive
god’s not dead no he is alive
god’s not dead no he is alive

praise him with my mouth
praise him with my feet
praise him with my hands
love him in my life
jesus is alive in me
god’s not dead


wildly life’s billows ’round my soul are beating
fierce is the tempest dangerous is the sea
driven by terror i come to thee pleading
“father in heaven o hear thou my plea”
 
   
   
     
     

in thy great mercy help me i implore thee
long have i struggled but to no avail
my strength is spenti cast myself before thee
“help me my father without thee i fall”
     
      
      
    


into the calmness of thy harbour guide me
instil a peace and trust within my soul
amid life’s tempest stay thou o’er beside me
bring me at last to my heavenly goal

when at last to our home we gather
with the loved ones who have gone before
we will sing upon the shore
praising him forevermore

can i doubt his tender mercy
who thro’ life has been my guide
    
    
   
  
   

heav’nly peace divinest comfort
here by faith in him to dwell
for i know whate’er befall me
jesus doeth all things well

perfect rest to me is promised
in my father’s house above

for here my heart is satisfied
within your presence

to see your beauty
to find you in the place

better is one day in your courts
than thousands elsewhere



my heart and flesh cry out
for you the living god

better is one day in your courts
better is one day in your house
better is one day in your courts
than thousands elsewhere

though the trials of life
may surround like a cloud
i’ve a peace that has come here to stay

then shall my latest breath
whisper thy praise
this be the parting cry

this still my prayer shall be
more love o christ to thee
more love to thee
more love to thee
     
   
 
  


he lives he lives
he triumphed over death
he lives he lives
the lord revealed his strength
   

   
   
   
   

he lives he lives
enthroned above all earthly strife
he leads us to eternal life
   
 
     

the wicked hands of sinners
had nailed him to the tree
our guilt and our transgressions
had caused his agony
  
  
  
  

the sweat like blood was flowing
from his disfigured brow
his task was done
oh praise him now
  
    
    

he lives he lives
he triumphed over death
he lives he lives
the lord revealed his strength

   
   
   
   

he lives he lives
enthroned above all earthly strife
he leads us to eternal life
   
 
     

his body then was taken
by joseph from the cross
in his own tomb he laid it
not counting it a loss
  
    
   
   

but suddenly the sun shone
and darkness took its flight
the lord had said
“let there be light”
   
   
    

he lives he lives
he triumphed over death
he lives he lives
the lord revealed his strength

   
   
   
   

he lives he lives
enthroned above all earthly strife
he leads us to eternal life
   
 
     

at dawn there came with mary
some women to the tomb
an angel stood beside them
and scattered all their gloom
   
   
  
   

“go quickly tell the others
that he is risen from the dead”
and death forever
lost its dread
  
   
   

he lives he lives
he triumphed over death
he lives he lives
the lord revealed his strength

   
   
   
   

he lives he lives
enthroned above all earthly strife
he leads us to eternal life
   
 
     

as mary stands bewildered
still grieving in her heart
she sees her risen saviour
and can’t contain her start
   
  
   
   

she shouts in exultation
“my master and my lord”
and quickly runs
to spread the word
   
  
    

he lives he lives
he triumphed over death
he lives he lives
the lord revealed his strength

   
   
   
   


he lives he lives
enthroned above all earthly strife
he leads us to eternal life

you know the way though it is hidden from me
since you are there my heart is filled with peace
why should i fear when you go on before me
both night and day you set my heart at ease
  
       
    
     
      

you know the way the time of my translation
was planned before i even lived one day
my heart is filled with wonder and elation
for you have loved and led me all the way
      
      
     
    

lord you know all the winds that blow and
frighten
the storms of life your orders still obey
and even though my burdens may not lighten
still i’m at peace because you know the way
     
    
     
      


there were ninety and nine that safely lay
in the shelter of the fold
but one was out on the hills away
far off from the gates of gold
  
   
     
     
     

away on the mountains wild and bare
away from the tender shepherd’s care
away from the tender shepherd’s care
    
     
     
lord thou hast here thy ninety and nine
are they not enough for thee
but the shepherd made answer
“this of mine
has wandered away from me
   
   
      
     

and although the road be rough and steep
i go to the desert to find my sheep
i go to the desert to find my sheep”
       
    
    
but none of the ransomed ever knew
how deep were the waters crossed
nor how dark was the night
that the lord passed thro’
ere he found his sheep that was lost
     
     
       
    

out in the desert he heard its cry
sick and helpless and ready to die
sick and helpless and ready to die
    
      
      
lord whence are those blood drops
all the way
that mark out the mountain’s track
they were shed for one who had gone
astray
ere the shepherd could bring him back

    
    
     
    

lord whence are thy hands so rent
and torn
they’re pierced tonight by many a thorn
they’re pierced tonight by many a thorn
     
     
     
but all thro’ the mountains thunder riv’n
and up from the rocky steep
there arose a glad cry to the gate
of heav’n
“rejoice i have found my sheep”
    
     
      
   


and the angels echoed around the throne
“rejoice for the lord brings back his own
rejoice for the lord brings back his own”
     
   
   


jesus my lord to thee i cry
unless thou help me i must die
oh bring thy free salvation nigh
and take me as i am
   
   
      
    
   

and take me as i am
and take me as i am
my only pleachrist died for me
oh take me as i am

   
   
    
   

helpless i am and full of guilt
but yet for me thy blood was spilt
and thou canst make me what thou wilt
and take me as i am
    
    
   
   

and take me as i am
and take me as i am
my only pleachrist died for me
oh take me as i am

   
   
    
   

no preparation can i make
my best resolves i only break
yet save me for thine own name’s sake
and take me as i am
   
    
     
   

and take me as i am
and take me as i am
my only pleachrist died for me
oh take me as i am

   
   
    
   

behold me saviour at thy feet
deal with me as thou seest meet
thy work begin thy work complete
and take me as i am
     
  
    
   


and take me as i am
and take me as i am
my only pleachrist died for me
oh take me as i am

   
   
    
   


i heard the voice of jesus say
“come unto me and rest
lay down thou weary one lay down
thy head upon my breast”
   
   
    
    
  

i came to jesus as i was
weary and worn and sad
i found in him a resting place
and he has made me glad
    
   
     
   

i heard the voice of jesus say
“behold i freely give
the living water thirsty one
stoop down and drink and live”
   
  
   
  

i came to jesus and i drank
of that life-giving stream
my thirst was quenched my soul revived
and now i live in him
     
  
     
   

i heard the voice of jesus say
“i am this dark world’s light
look unto me thy morn shall rise
and all thy day be bright”
   
     
    
   


i looked to jesus and i found
in him my star my sun
and in that light of life i’ll walk
till travelling days are done

jesus saviour pilot me
over life’s tempestuous sea
unknown waves before me roll
hiding rocks and treach’rous shoal
chart and compass come from thee
jesus saviour pilot me
    
    
  
   
   
   
    
as a mother stills her child
thou canst hush the ocean wild
boist’rous waves obey thy will
when thou say’st to them “be still”
wondrous sov’reign of the sea
jesus saviour pilot me
   
   
   
 
  
    

when at last i near the shore
and the fearful breakers roar
’twixt me and the peaceful rest
then while leaning on thy breast
may i hear thee say to me
“fear not i will pilot thee”
     
   
   
    
   
    


have your sins been washed in the flow
from the cross on dark calvary
and the one who died do you know
that from sin you might ransomed be
    
    
    
    
    

though like scarlet your sins may be
heavy though the weight of your woe
his blood can make you free from sin
it can make them whiter than snow

     
   
   
    

on the cross forsaken was he
from the cross his blood trickled down
that mankind from sin could be free
for the cross exchanged he his crown
  
   
    
   

though like scarlet your sins may be
heavy though the weight of your woe
his blood can make you free from sin
it can make them whiter than snow

     
   
   
    

jesus called and i did reply
“come to me” he saidi did go
what i was no longer am i
his blood made me whiter than snow
    
    
    
    

though like scarlet your sins may be
heavy though the weight of your woe
his blood can make you free from sin
it can make them whiter than snow

     
   
   
    

like the wayward lamb i had strayed
“pastures green” were silver and gold
on the cross atonement was made
jesus brought me back to the fold
    
   
    
     

though like scarlet your sins may be
heavy though the weight of your woe
his blood can make you free from sin
it can make them whiter than snow

     
   
   
    

contemplating i love to see
from the cross the life-giving flow
to us bringing grace full and free
by it making us white as snow
   
   
     
    


though like scarlet your sins may be
heavy though the weight of your woe
his blood can make you free from sin
it can make them whiter than snow

     
   
   
    


on a hill far away
stood an old rugged cross
the emblem of suffering and shame
and i love that old cross
where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain
    

      
    
       
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

   
    
    
    

oh that old rugged cross
so despised by the world
has a wondrous attraction for me
for the dear lamb of god left his glory above
to bear it to dark calvary
     

      
        
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

   
    
    
    
in that old rugged cross
stained with blood so divine
a wondrous beauty i see
for ’twas on that old cross
jesus suffered and died
to pardon and sanctify me
     
 
     
     
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

   
    
    
    

to the old rugged cross i will ever be true
it’s shame and reproach gladly bear
then he’ll call me some day
to my home far away
where his glory forever i’ll share
     

     
      
     


so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

my god my father while i stray
far from my home on life’s rough way
oh teach me from my heart to say
“thy will be done”
   
   
    
  
  

thy will be done
thy will be done
oh teach me from my heart to say
“thy will be done”
  
  
  
  

though thou hast called me to resign
what most i prized it ne’er was mine
i have but yielded what was thine
“thy will be done”
    
     
    
  

thy will be done
thy will be done
i have but yielded what was thine
“thy will be done”

my life in premature decay

thy will be done
thy will be done
my father still i strive to say
“thy will be done”
  
  
    
  

renew my will from day to day
blend it with thine and take away
all that now makes it hard to say
“thy will be done”
   
    
   
  

thy will be done
thy will be done
all that now makes it hard to say
“thy will be done”
  
  
   
  

then when on earth i breathe no more
the prayer oft mixed with tears before
i’ll sing upon a happier shore
“thy will be done”
    
    
    
  


thy will be done
thy will be done
i’ll sing upon a happier shore
“thy will be done”

what means this eager anxious throng
which moves with busy haste along
these wondrous gatherings day by day
what means this strange commotion pray
   
   
-    
   
   

in accents hushed the throng reply
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”
in accents hushed the throng reply
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”
    
  
    
  

who is this jesus why should he
the city move so mightily
a passing stranger has he skill
to move the multitude at will
     
   
   
   

again the stirring tones reply
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”
again the stirring tones reply
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”
    
  
    
  

jesus ’tis he who once below
man’s pathway trod ’mid pain and woe
and burdened ones where’er he came
brought out their sick and deaf and lame
     
    
   
   

the blind rejoiced to hear the cry
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”
the blind rejoiced to hear the cry
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”
   
  
   
  

again he comes from place to place
his holy footprints we can trace
he pauseth at our thresholdnay
he enterscondescends to stay
    
    
    
      

shall we not gladly raise the cry
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”
shall we not gladly raise the cry
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”
    
  
    
  

ho all ye heavy laden come
here’s pardon comfort rest and home
ye wand’rers from a father’s face
return accept his proffered grace
   
     
    
    

ye tempted ones there’s refuge nigh
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”
ye tempted ones there’s refuge nigh
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”
     
  
     
  

but if you still his call refuse
and all his wondrous love abuse
soon will he sadly from you turn
your bitter prayer for pardon spurn
   
   
  
    


“too late too late” will be the cry
“jesus of nazareth has passed by”
“too late too late” will be the cry
“jesus of nazareth has passed by”

i cannot tell
how he whom angels worship
should stoop to love
the peoples of the earth
or why as shepherd
he should seek the wand’rer
with his mysterious
promise of new birth
i cannot tell

but this i know
that he was born of mary
when bethl’em’s manger
was his only home
and that he lived
at nazareth and laboured
and so the saviour
saviour of the world is come

i cannot tell
how silently he suffered
as with his peace
he graced this place of tears
or how his heart
upon the cross was broken
the crown of pain
to three and thirty years

but this i know
he heals the broken-hearted
and stays our sin
and calms our lurking fear
and lifts the burden
from the heavy laden
for yet the saviour
saviour of the world is here

i cannot tell
how he will win the nations
how he will claim
his earthly heritage
how satisfy the needs
and aspirations
of east and west
of sinner and of sage

but this i know
all flesh shall see his glory
and he shall reap
the harvest he has sown
and some glad day
his sun shall shine in splendour
when he the saviour
saviour of the world is known

i cannot tell
how all the lands shall worship
when at his bidding
ev’ry storm is stilled
or who can say
how great the jubilation
when ev’ry heart
with perfect love is filled


but this i know
the skies will thrill with rapture
and myriad myriad
human voices sing
and earth to heav’n
and heav’n to earth will answer
“at last the saviour
saviour of the world is king”


take me past the outer courts
and through the holy place
past the brazen altar
lord i want to see your face

pass me by the crowds of people
and the priests who sing their praise
i hunger and thirst for your righteousness
but it’s only found one place
  take me past the outer courts



so take me in to the holy of holies
take me in by the blood of the lamb
so take me in to the holy of holies
take the coal cleanse my lips
here i am



is it true today
that when people pray
cloudless skies will break
kings and queens will shake
yes it’s true and i believe it
i’m living for you
is it true today


well it’s true today
that when people pray
we’ll see dead men rise
and the blind set free
yes it’s true and i believe it
i’m living for you

i’m going to be a history maker
in this land
i’m going to be a speaker of truth
to all mankind

i’m going to stand
i’m going to run into your arms
into your arms again
into your arms into your arms again
well it’s true today
that when people stand
with the fire of god
and the truth in hand

we’ll see miracles
we’ll see angels sing
we’ll see broken hearts
making history
yes it’s true and i believe it
i’m living for you



i’m going to be a history maker
in this land
i’m going to be a speaker of truth
to all mankind

i’m going to stand
i’m going to run into your arms
into your arms again
into your arms into your arms again


when jesus i knew not i did not know life
i spent all my days in contention and strife
then i heard a voice which all trouble surmounts
“he loves you he loves you”
how sweetly it sounds

„     ”

in sin i was dead
but now i am saved
“he loves you he loves you”
how sweetly it sounds

when i am depressed by life’s troubles
and wrongs
and nowhere my spirit finds solace and songs
this message from heaven in echo resounds
“he loves you he loves you”
how sweetly it sounds
      
      
     
„   ”  


in sin i was dead
but now i am saved
“he loves you he loves you”

i am a stranger here within a foreign land
my home is far away upon a golden strand
ambassador to be of realms beyond the sea
i’m here on business for my king
   
       
      
     
  

this is the message that i bring
a message angels fain would sing
“oh be ye reconciled”
thus saith my lord and king
“oh be ye reconciled to god”

   
   
   
   
   
this is the king’s command that all men
everywhere
repent and turn away from sin’s seductive snare
that all who will obey with him shall reign for
aye
and that’s my business for my king
     
     
      
  

this is the message that i bring
a message angels fain would sing
“oh be ye reconciled”
thus saith my lord and king
“oh be ye reconciled to god”

   
   
   
   
   

my home is brighter far than sharon’s rosy plain
eternal life and joy throughout its vast domain
my sovereign bids me tell how mortals there
may dwell
and that’s my business for my king
      
      
      
  


this is the message that i bring
a message angels fain would sing
“oh be ye reconciled”
thus saith my lord and king
“oh be ye reconciled to god”

   
   
   
   
   


   
   
     
    
    

   
     
   
     
      

i will enter his gates
with thanksgiving in my heart
i will enter his courts with praise
i will say this is the day
that the lord has made
i will rejoice for he has made me glad

he has made me glad
he has made me glad
i will rejoice for he has made me glad
  



jesus how lovely you are
you are so gentle so loving and kind
you shine like the bright morning star
jesus how lovely you are
      
   
        
    
   


he lifted me out
of the miry clay
he set my feet on
the solid rock
     
  
  
  
  


and that’s why i sing
all praise to him
for he came to save
me from my sin
  
  
   
 


where holy spirit lives in hearts
there happiness descends
unites the people of the world
both enemies and friends
    
     
   
   
   

o lord your love please send to them
let love and peace shine on their way
and make the two as only one
so glory be to you each day

   
   
    
   

where god’s love reigns abundantly
there’s peace no strife is there
the lord protects them faithfully
no other one need care
   
    
   
     

o lord your love please send to them
let love and peace shine on their way
and make the two as only one
so glory be to you each day

   
   
    
   
where god’s love dwells in people’s
hearts
that nation is at peace
since god is ruling in their lives
there’s happiness complete
   
    
   
   


o lord your love please send to them
let love and peace shine on their way
and make the two as only one
so glory be to you each day

   
   
    
   


blessd be the fountain of blood
to a world of sinners revealed
blessd be the dear son of god
only by his stripes we are healed
    
    
   
    
  

tho’ i’ve wandered far from his fold
bringing to my heart pain and woe
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow
  
   
  
    

whiter than the snow
whiter than the snow
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow

   
  
    

thorny was the crown that he wore
and the cross his body o’ercame
grievous were the sorrows he bore
but he suffered thus not in vain
   
    
    
   

may i to that fountain be led
made to cleanse my sins here below
wash me in the blood that he shed
and i shall be whiter than snow
   
    
  
    

whiter than the snow
whiter than the snow
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow

   
  
    

father i have wandered from thee
often has my heart gone astray
crimson do my sins seem to me
water cannot wash them away
    
   
    
    

jesus to the fountain of thine
leaning on thy promise i go
cleanse me by thy washing divine
and i shall be whiter than snow
  
    
  
    


whiter than the snow
whiter than the snow
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow

i’ve found a friend o such a friend
he loved me ere i knew him
he drew me with the cords of love
and thus he bound me to him
   
   
   
  
   

and round my heart still closely twine
those ties which naught can sever
for i am his and he is mine
forever and forever
    
   
     
  

i’ve found a friend o such a friend
he bled he died to save me
and not alone the gift of life
but his own self he gave me
   
   
     
   

naught that i have mine own i call
i’ll hold it for the giver
my heart my strength my life my all
are his and his forever
     
   
    
  

i’ve found a friend o such a friend
all pow’r to him is given
to guard me on my onward course
and bring me safe to heaven

to nerve my faint endeavour
so now to watch to work to war
and then to rest forever
  
  
      
  

i’ve found a friend o such a friend
so kind and true and tender
so wise a counsellor and guide
so mighty a defender
   
   
    
 


from him who loves me now so well
what power my soul can sever
shall life or death shall earth or hell
no i am his forever

did you feel the mountains tremble
did you hear the oceans roar
when the people rose to sing of
jesus christ the risen one

did you feel the people tremble
did you hear the singers roar
when the lost began to sing of
jesus christ the saving one

  did you feel the mountains


and we can see that god
you’re moving
a mighty river through the nations
and young and old will turn to jesus

fling wide you heavenly gates
prepare the way of the risen lord


open up the doors and
let the music play
let the streets resound with singing
songs that bring your hope
songs that bring your joy
dancers who dance upon injustice



do you feel the darkness tremble
when all the saints join in one song
and all the streams flow as one river
to wash away our brokenness



and we can see that god
you’re moving
a time of jubilee is coming
when young and old will turn to jesus

fling wide you heavenly gates
prepare the way of the risen lord



open up the doors and
let the music play
let the streets resound with singing
songs that bring your hope
songs that bring your joy
dancers who dance upon injustice


up calvary’s mountain one dreadful morn
walked christ my saviour weary and worn
facing for sinners death on the cross
that he might save them from endless loss
  
   
     
    
     

blessd redeemer precious redeemer
seems now i see him on calvary’s tree
wounded and bleeding for sinners pleading
blind and unheedingdying for me

   
     
    
     

“father forgive them” thus did he pray
e’en while his lifeblood flowed fast away
praying for sinners while in such woe
no one but jesus ever loved so
     
     
    
     

blessd redeemer precious redeemer
seems now i see him on calvary’s tree
wounded and bleeding for sinners pleading
blind and unheedingdying for me

   
     
    
     

o how i love him saviour and friend
how can my praises ever find end
through years unnumbered on heaven’s
shore
my tongue shall praise him forevermore

heart oppressed by sin
open now the door for jesus

and receive you there

than the deepest of seas

his love it stretches
to the farthest horizon
and his love it reaches to me

in my life’s darkest hour

his love secures me
on the pathway to heaven
and his love is my strength and power

his love is sweeter
than the sweetest of honey
his love is better
than the choicest of wine

his love it satisfies
the deepest of hunger
and his love in jesus it’s mine


your love is higher
than the highest of mountains
your love goes deeper
than the deepest of seas

your love it stretches

and your love it reaches to me

there is a fountain filled with blood
drawn from emmanuel’s veins
and sinners plunged beneath that flood
lose all their guilty stains
   
   
  
    
   

the dying thief rejoiced to see
that fountain in his day
and there may i though vile as he
wash all my sins away
    
    
     
   

dear dying lamb thy precious blood
shall never lose its pow’r
till all the ransomed church of god
are saved to sin no more
   
   
    
  

e’er since by faith i saw the stream
thy flowing wounds supply
redeeming love has been my theme
and shall be till i die
   
   
   
  
when this poor lisping
stammering tongue
lies silent in the grave
then in a nobler sweeter song
i’ll sing thy power to save

our god is so great
so strong and so mighty
there’s nothing that he cannot do

the rivers are his
the mountains are his
the stars are his handiwork too

our god is so great
so strong and so mighty
there’s nothing that he cannot do
our god is so great


begin my tongue some heavenly theme
and speak some boundless thing
the mighty works or mightier name
of our eternal king
    
   
 
  
  

tell of his wonderful faithfulness
and sound his power abroad
sing the sweet promise of his grace
the love and truth of god
     
   
   
  

proclaim “salvation from the lord
for wretched dying men”
his hand has writ the sacred word
with an immortal pen
  
   
    
  

his every word of grace is strong
as that which built the skies
the voice that rolls the stars along
speaks all the promises
   
  
  
   


o might i hear thy heavenly tongue
but whisper “thou art mine”
those gentle words shall raise my song
to notes almost divine
    
    
   
    


on calvary’s brow my saviour died
’twas there my lord was crucified
’twas on the cross he bled for me
and purchased there my pardon free
    
    
    
       
    

o calvary dark calvary
where jesus shed his blood for me
o calvary blest calvary
’twas there my saviour died for me

   
      
   
     

’mid rending rocks and darkening skies
my saviour bows his head and dies
the opening veil reveals the way
to life divine and endless day
     
   
    
     

o calvary dark calvary
where jesus shed his blood for me
o calvary blest calvary
’twas there my saviour died for me

   
      
   
     

o jesus lord how can it be
that thou shouldst give thy life for me
to bear the cross and agony
in that dread hour on calvary
   
     
     
     


o calvary dark calvary
where jesus shed his blood for me
o calvary blest calvary
’twas there my saviour died for me

   
      
   
     


were you there when they crucified my lord
were you there when they crucified my lord
oh sometimes it causes me to tremble
tremble tremble
were you there when they crucified my lord

were you there when they nailed him to the tree
were you there when they nailed him to the tree
oh sometimes it causes me to tremble
tremble tremble
were you there when they nailed him to the tree
  were you there

were you there when they laid him in the tomb
were you there when they laid him in the tomb
oh sometimes it causes me to tremble
tremble tremble
were you there when they laid him in the tomb

were you there when he rose up from the grave
were you there when he rose up from the grave
oh sometimes it causes me to tremble
tremble tremble
were you there when he rose up from the grave


jesus the very thought of thee
with sweetness fills my breast
but sweeter far thy face to see
and in thy presence rest
   
   
  
    
    

no voice can sing no heart can frame
nor can the mem’ry find
a sweeter sound than thy blest name
o saviour of mankind
   
  
    
   

o hope of every contrite heart
o joy of all the meek
to those who fall how kind thou art
how good to those who seek
  
    
   
    

but what to those who find ah this
nor tongue nor pen can show
the love of jesus what it is
none but his loved ones know
    
   
   
    

o jesus light of all below
thou fount of living fire
surpassing all the joys we know
and all we can desire
     
  
    
  


jesus our only joy be thou
as thou our prize wilt be
jesus be thou our glory now
and through eternity
   
  
   
   


the wonder of your cross
shall be our meditation
to gather in that shadow
as the sun went down

to weep with those who thought
that you were leaving
you were leaving jesus
the humble king
who never wore an earthly crown
  the wonder of your cross
to steal away at night
when they took down your body
with love and tears to leave you
in a borrowed grave

to go with mary to
that place they laid you
where they laid you jesus
and in the morning
find the stone was rolled away



the cross o the wonderful cross
what glory what victory i’ve found
i’ll come to the wonderful cross
and my whole life i lay down
were heaven’s praises silent
in those hours of darkness
your holy spirit brooding
’round that empty throne

until the declaration
“he is risen”
you are risen jesus
he is not dead
behold he lives for evermore




the cross o the wonderful cross
what glory what victory i’ve found
i’ll come to the wonderful cross
and my whole life i lay down


in the land of strangers
whither thou art gone

“my son my son”

“must i go and empty handed”
thus my dear redeemer meet
not one day of service give him
lay no trophy at his feet
    
    
   
     
    

“must i go and empty handed”
must i meet my saviour so
not one soul with which to greet him
must i empty handed go

    
   
    
 

not at death i shrink or falter
for my saviour saves me now
but to meet him empty handed
thought of that now clouds my brow
   
    
    
    

“must i go and empty handed”
must i meet my saviour so
not one soul with which to greet him
must i empty handed go

    
   
    
 

o the years in sinning wasted
could i but recall them now
i would give them to my saviour
to his will i’d gladly bow
    
  
    
   

“must i go and empty handed”
must i meet my saviour so
not one soul with which to greet him
must i empty handed go

    
   
    
 

o ye saints arouse be earnest
up and work while yet ’tis day
ere the night of death o’ertake thee
strive for souls while still you may
   
   
    
   


“must i go and empty handed”
must i meet my saviour so
not one soul with which to greet him
must i empty handed go

    
   
    
 


loved with everlasting love
led by grace that love to know
spirit breathing from above
thou hast taught me it is so
  
  
  
    
  
o this full and perfect peace
from his presence all divine

in a love which cannot cease
i am his and he is mine   
   
  

    
     
heav’n above is softer blue
earth around is sweeter green
something lives in every hue
christless eyes have never seen
   
   
   
   
birds with gladder songs o’erflow
flow’rs with deeper beauties shine

since i know as i now know
i am his and he is mine   
  
    

   
     
things that once were wild alarms
cannot now disturb my rest
closed in everlasting arms
pillowed on the loving breast
   
   
    
     
o to lie forever here
doubt and care and self resign

while he whispers in my ear
i am his and he is mine   
    
   

    
     
his forever only his
who the lord and me shall part
ah with what a rest of bliss
christ can fill the loving heart
   
   
     
    

heav’n and earth may fade and flee
first-born light in gloom decline

but while god and i shall be
i am his and he is mine   
   
    

    
     


deeper than the deepest of the oceans
everlasting deep beyond compare
higher than the highest lights of heaven
is the love that christ with us does share
    
    
  
     
  

he has cleansed me from sin’s blight
and given me robes of pure white
and his holy spirit gave to me
i now am in his family

   
   
   
   

dark and fearful striking me with terror
were the years that i had spent in sin
i was lost unfortunate and hopeless
jesus found me and he took me in
   
     
   
     

he has cleansed me from sin’s blight
and given me robes of pure white
and his holy spirit gave to me
i now am in his family

   
   
   
   

praise the lord for by the grace of jesus
i am saved from sin and death set free
over me sin has no more dominion
jesus christ my saviour dwells in me
   
     
    
     


he has cleansed me from sin’s blight
and given me robes of pure white
and his holy spirit gave to me
i now am in his family

the love of god is greater far
than tongue or pen can ever tell
it goes beyond the highest star
and reaches to the lowest hell
    
  
    
   
   

the guilty pair bowed down with care
god gave his son to win
his erring child he reconciled
and pardoned from his sin
     
    
    
  

o love of god how rich and pure
how measureless and strong
it shall forevermore endure
the saints’ and angels’ song

  
  
   
   

when years of time shall pass away
and earthly thrones and kingdoms fall
when men who here refuse to pray
on rocks and hills and mountains call
   
  
  
   

god’s love so sure shall still endure
all measureless and strong
redeeming grace to adam’s race
the saints’ and angels’ song
    
  
    
   

o love of god how rich and pure
how measureless and strong
it shall forevermore endure
the saints’ and angels’ song

  
  
   
   

could we with ink the ocean fill
and were the skies of parchment made
were ev’ry stalk on earth a quill
and ev’ry man a scribe by trade
    
   
      
   

to write the love of god above
would drain the ocean dry
nor could the scroll contain the whole
tho’ stretched from sky to sky

give me the wings of faith to rise
within the veil to see
the saints above how great their joys
how bright their glories be
  
    
  
    
   

many are the friends who are waiting today
happy on the golden strand
many are the voices calling us away
to join their glorious band

    
   
    
  

once they were mourners here below
and poured out cries and tears
they wrestled hard as we do now
with sins and doubts and fears
    
   
   
  

many are the friends who are waiting today
happy on the golden strand
many are the voices calling us away
to join their glorious band

    
   
    
  

i asked them whence their vict’ry came
they with united breath
ascribe their conquest to the lamb
their triumph to his death
    
  
    
   


many are the friends who are waiting today
happy on the golden strand
many are the voices calling us away
to join their glorious band

beside the crystal sea
  
     
   
    
   

this world is not a home for me
i yearn for heaven’s shore
i long to be with all the saints
and rest forevermore
    
  
     
  

heavenward heavenward
i now lift my eyes
for god has promised rest for all
who enter paradise
   
   
    
      

the days are long the battle fierce
and i must do my part
on earth i find no resting place
or healing for my heart
    
    
   
  

maybe soon very soon
i must take my flight
at last to enter into rest
my father’s house of light
   
  
    
   


what human eye has never seen
no human ear has heard
what human mind could not conceive
god promised in his word

whose arm hath bound the restless wave
who bid’st the mighty ocean deep
its own appointed limits keep
   
   
   
  
   ―

oh hear us when we cry to thee
for those in peril on the sea
  
   

o christ whose voice the waters heard
and hushed their raging at thy word
who walkedst on the foaming deep
and calm amidst its rage didst sleep
  ―    
  
    
    ―

oh hear us when we cry to thee
for those in peril on the sea

upon the chaos dark and rude
and bid its angry tumult cease
and give for wild confusion peace

for those in peril on the sea

obedient to death you overcame
  you chose the cross


i’m lost in wonder
i’m lost in love
i’m lost in praise for evermore

because of jesus’ unfailing love
i am forgiven
i am restored
you loosed the cords of sinfulness
and broke the chains of my disgrace
you chose the cross

up from the grave victorious
you rose again so glorious
you chose the cross

the sorrow that surrounded you
was mine
“yet not my will but yours be done”
you said



i’m lost in wonder
i’m lost in love
i’m lost in praise for evermore

because of jesus’ unfailing love
i am forgiven
i am restored


there’s a dear and precious book
though it’s worn and faded now
which recalls those happy days of long ago
when i stood at mother’s knee
with her hand upon my brow
and i heard her voice in gentle tones and low

on thy dear old tear stained leaves i love to look
thou art sweeter day by day
as i walk the narrow way
that leads at last to that bright home above

   
     
   
    
       

then she read of jesus’ love
as he blessed the children dear
how he suffered bled and died upon the tree
of his heavy load of care
then she dried my flowing tears
with her kisses as she said it was for me

and ever in my heart his words abide

now flowing for all men
come roll over me

with fears
my life has been joyless and useless for years

if once thy pure waters
would roll over me
     
     
     
   
   

the tide is now flowing i’m touching the wave
i hear the loud call of the mighty to save

when the storms of life are raging
tempests wild on sea and land
i will seek a place of refuge
in the shadow of god’s hand
    
    
  
   
  

he will hide me he will hide me
where no harm can e’er betide me
he will hide me safely hide me
in the shadow of his hand

   
   
  
   

enemies may strive to injure
satan all his arts employ
he will turn what seems to harm me
into everlasting joy
   
  
   
    

he will hide me he will hide me
where no harm can e’er betide me
he will hide me safely hide me
in the shadow of his hand

   
   
  
   

tho’ he may send some affliction
’twill but make me long for home
for in love and not in anger
all his chastenings will come
    
    
   
   

he will hide me he will hide me
where no harm can e’er betide me
he will hide me safely hide me
in the shadow of his hand

   
   
  
   

so while here the cross i’m bearing
meeting storms and billows wild
jesus for my soul is caring
naught can harm his father’s child
    
   
    
    


he will hide me he will hide me
where no harm can e’er betide me
he will hide me safely hide me
in the shadow of his hand

   
   
  
   

sweet hour of prayer
sweet hour of prayer
that calls me from a world of care
and bids me at my father’s throne
make all my wants and wishes known
 
   
   
   
  
in seasons of distress and grief
my soul has often found relief
and oft escaped the tempter’s snare
by thy return sweet hour of prayer
    
   
    
    
sweet hour of prayer
sweet hour of prayer
thy wings shall my petition bear
to him whose truth and faithfulness
engage the waiting soul to bless
   
    
     
   
and since he bids me seek his face
believe his word and trust his grace
i’ll cast on him my ev’ry care
and wait for thee sweet hour of prayer
   
    
   
    
sweet hour of prayer
sweet hour of prayer
may i thy consolation share
’til from mount pisgah’s lofty height
i view my home and take my flight
   
    
   
    

this robe of flesh i’ll drop and rise
to seize the everlasting prize
and shout while passing through the air
farewell farewell sweet hour of prayer
   
     
    
   


i can hear my saviour calling
i can hear my saviour calling
i can hear my saviour calling
“take thy cross and follow follow me”
  
  
  
  
  
   

where he leads me i will follow
where he leads me i will follow
where he leads me i will follow
i’ll go with him with him all the way
    
    
    
     

i’ll go with him through the garden
i’ll go with him through the garden
i’ll go with him through the garden
i’ll go with him with him all the way
     
     
     
     

i’ll go with him through the judgement
i’ll go with him through the judgement
i’ll go with him through the judgement
i’ll go with him with him all the way
    
    
    
   

he will give me grace and glory
he will give me grace and glory
he will give me grace and glory
and go with me with me all the way

since jesus came into my heart
floods of joy o’er my soul
like the sea billows roll

i shall go there to dwell in that city i know
since jesus came into my heart
and i’m happy so happy as onward i go
since jesus came into my heart
      
 
   
      
   


since jesus came into my heart
since jesus came into my heart
floods of joy o’er my soul

children of the heavenly father
safely in his bosom gather
nestling bird nor star in heaven
such a refuge e’er was given
    
    
   
     
   

god his own doth tend and nourish
in his holy courts they flourish
from all evil things he spares them
in his mighty arms he bears them
   
  
  
    

neither life nor death shall ever
from the lord his children sever
unto them his grace he showeth
and their sorrows all he knoweth
     
   
    
   

praise the lord in joyful numbers
your protector never slumbers
at the will of your defender
ev’ry foeman must surrender
   
   
    
  


though he giveth or he taketh
god his children ne’er forsaketh
his the loving purpose solely
to preserve them pure and holy
    ―
   
  
   


lead kindly light amid th’ encircling
gloom lead thou me on
the night is dark and i am far from
home lead thou me on
  
     
  
     
 

keep thou my feet
i do not ask to see
the distant scene
one step enough for me
  
  
 
    

i was not ever thus nor prayed
that thou shouldst lead me on
i loved to choose and see my path
but now lead thou me on
      
 
      
 

i loved the garish day
and spite of fears
pride ruled my will
remember not past years
 
    
 
  

so long thy power hath blest me
sure it still will lead me on
o’er moor and fen o’er crag and torrent
till the night is gone
      
 
     
  


and with the morn
those angel-faces smile
which i have loved
long since and lost awhile
  
  
 
  


on the shore of jordan’s river
in expectation we all stand
there by faith we see the shimmer
of our new and promised land
   
   
   
   
   

let us live in expectation
of that moment when the lord
will receive us into his kingdom
as he promised in his word

   
   
    
   

like the sun in radiant glory
glows the new jerusalem
songs of praises tell the story
of that precious priceless gem
    
  
   
  

let us live in expectation
of that moment when the lord
will receive us into his kingdom
as he promised in his word

   
   
    
   

many saints their race have finished
crossed the jordan with a prayer
and we too shall cross that river
very soon we’ll all be there
   
   
   
    

let us live in expectation
of that moment when the lord
will receive us into his kingdom
as he promised in his word

   
   
    
   

shades of death engulf the river
but beyond its deathly throes
lies the kingdom of the blessed
and the end of all our woes
   
   
  
    


let us live in expectation
of that moment when the lord
will receive us into his kingdom
as he promised in his word

   
   
    
   


every day with jesus
is sweeter than the day before
every passing moment
i love him more and more
      
   
     
   
   


jesus saves and keeps me
and he’s the one i’m waiting for
every day with jesus
is sweeter than the day before
  
    
   
   


am i a soldier of the cross
a follower of the lamb
and shall i fear to own his cause
or blush to speak his name
     
     
   
     
   

must i be carried to the skies
on flowery beds of ease
while others fought to win the prize
and sailed through bloody seas
    
    
     
    

are there no foes for me to face
must i not stem the flood
is this vile world a friend to grace
to help me on to god
    
     
   
   


sure i must fight if i would reign
increase my courage lord
i’ll bear the toil endure the pain
supported by thy word
    
    
      
      


teach me lord how to pray in contrition
and your holy commands to fulfil
free my heart from its pride and ambition
may it always conform to your will
may it always conform to your will
   
   
   
   
    
    

may you reign in my heart without measure
and your spirit my spirit control
may in you i find all of my pleasure
and your name in my heart thus extol
and your name in my heart thus extol
     
     
    
    
    


cleansed within by the blood of my saviour
may my heart be kept free from all sin
may it find its delight and its favour
as it loves both my foes and my kin
as it loves both my foes and my kin
   
    
   
    
    


work for the night is coming
work through the morning hours
work while the dew is sparkling
work ’mid springing flowers
  
  
   
  
 

work when the day grows brighter
work in the glowing sun
work for the night is coming
when man’s work is done
  
    
   
  

work for the night is coming
work through the sunny noon
fill brightest hours with labour
rest comes sure and soon
   
   
  
  

give every flying minute
something to keep in store
work for the night is coming
when man works no more
    
  
   
  

work for the night is coming
under the sunset skies
while their bright tints are glowing
work for daylight flies
  
   
   
 

work till the last beam fadeth
fadeth to shine no more
work while the night is darkening
when man’s work is o’er

rock of ages cleft for me
let me hide myself in thee
let the water and the blood
from thy wounded side which flowed
be of sin the double cure
save from wrath and make me pure
 
 
  
   
     
   
   
not the labour of my hands
can fulfil thy law’s demands
could my zeal no respite know
could my tears forever flow
all for sin could not atone
thou must save and thou alone
    
    
  
   
    
    
nothing in my hand i bring
simply to the cross i cling
naked come to thee for dress
helpless look to thee for grace
foul i to the fountain fly
wash me saviour or i die
     
     
     
    
    
    

while i draw this fleeting breath
when my eyes shall close in death
while i rise to worlds unknown
and behold thee on thy throne
rock of ages cleft for me
let me hide myself in thee

mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the lord
he is trampling out the vintage
where the grapes of wrath are stored
   
   
 
   
   

he hath loosed the fateful lightning
of his terrible swift sword
his truth is marching on
   
   
   

glory glory hallelujah
glory glory hallelujah
glory glory hallelujah
his truth is marching on

  
  
  
  

i have seen him in the watch-fires
of a hundred circling camps
they have builded him an altar
in the evening dews and damps
    
  
  
    

i can read his righteous sentence
by the dim and flaring lamps
his day is marching on
  
   
  

glory glory hallelujah
glory glory hallelujah
glory glory hallelujah
his day is marching on

  
  
  
  

he has sounded forth the trumpet
that shall never sound retreat
he is sifting out the hearts of men
before his judgement seat
   
  
  
  

o be swift my soul to answer
him be jubilant my feet
our god is marching on

master the tempest is raging
the billows are tossing high
the sky is o'ershadow with blackness
no shelter or help is nigh
  
  
   
   
    
carest thou not that we perish
how canst thou lie asleep
when each moment so madly
is threatening
a grave in the angry deep
   
   
    
  

the winds and the waves
shall obey thy will
peace be still

   
  
 

whether the wrath of the storm tossed sea
or demons or men or whatever it be
no waters can swallow the ship where lies
the master of ocean and earth and skies
  
   
     
     

they all shall sweetly obey thy will
peace be still peace be still
they all shall sweetly obey thy will
peace peace be still

the depths of my sad heart are troubled
oh waken and save i pray
   
  
  
   

torrents of sin and of anguish
sweep o’er my sinking soul
and i perish i perish dear master
oh hasten and take control
  
  
      
   

the winds and the waves
shall obey thy will
peace be still

and heaven’s within my breast

leave me alone no more
and with joy i shall make the blest
harbour
and rest on the blissful shore

shall obey thy will
peace be still

there is a green hill far away
outside a city wall
where the dear lord was crucified
who died to save us all
   
    
  
     
   

o dearly dearly has he loved
and we must love him too
and trust in his redeeming blood
and try his works to do

   
  
  
   

we may not know we cannot tell
what pains he had to bear
but we believe it was for us
he hung and suffered there
  
   
     
   

o dearly dearly has he loved
and we must love him too
and trust in his redeeming blood
and try his works to do

   
  
  
   

he died that we might be forgiv’n
he died to make us good
that we might go at last to heav’n
saved by his precious blood
   
   
    
   

o dearly dearly has he loved
and we must love him too
and trust in his redeeming blood
and try his works to do

   
  
  
   

there was no other good enough
to pay the price of sin
he only could unlock the gate
of heaven and let us in
   
  
   
  


o dearly dearly has he loved
and we must love him too
and trust in his redeeming blood
and try his works to do

amazing grace how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me
i once was lost but now am found
was blind but now i see
     
   
   
      
     

’twas grace that taught my heart to fear
and grace my fears relieved
how precious did that grace appear
the hour i first believed
   
   
     
   

thro’ many dangers toils and snares
i have already come
’tis grace that brought me safe thus far
and grace will lead me home
    
   
     
  

the earth shall soon dissolve like snow
the sun forbear to shine
but god who called me here below
shall be forever mine
   
    
       
   

yea when this flesh and heart shall fail
and mortal life shall cease
i shall possess within the veil
a life of joy and peace
    
  
    
   

when we’ve been there
ten thousand years
bright shining as the sun
we’ve no less days to sing god’s praise
than when we first begun
   
  
    
    

in tenderness he sought me
weary and sick with sin
and on his shoulders brought me
back to his fold again
while angels in his presence sang
until the courts of heaven rang
   
 
  
   
   
    
    

oh the love that sought me
oh the blood that bought me
oh the grace that brought me to the fold
wondrous grace that brought me to the fold

  
  
  
  
he washed the bleeding sin wounds
and poured in oil and wine
he whispered to assure me
“i’ve found thee thou art mine”
i never heard a sweeter voice
it made my aching heart rejoice
  
   
  
    
   
   

oh the love that sought me
oh the blood that bought me
oh the grace that brought me to the fold
wondrous grace that brought me to the fold

  
  
  
  
he pointed to the nail prints
for me his blood was shed
a mocking crown so thorny
was placed upon his head
i wondered what he saw in me
to suffer such deep agony
   
   
 
  
    
     

oh the love that sought me
oh the blood that bought me
oh the grace that brought me to the fold
wondrous grace that brought me to the fold

  
  
  
  
i’m sitting in his presence
the sunshine of his face
while with adoring wonder
his blessings i retrace
it seems as if eternal days
are far too short to sound his praise
  
     
  
    
   
     

oh the love that sought me
oh the blood that bought me
oh the grace that brought me to the fold
wondrous grace that brought me to the fold

  
  
  
  
so while the hours are passing
all now is perfect rest
i’m waiting for the morning
the brightest and the best
when he will call us to his side
to be with him his spotless bride
   
   
 
   
    
    


oh the love that sought me
oh the blood that bought me
oh the grace that brought me to the fold
wondrous grace that brought me to the fold

jesus promised that he
present with us would be

oh how pleasant it is
in his presence to meet
shutting out the world’s tumult and din
  
  
    

how rewarding it is
just to sit at his feet
and receive untold blessings from him
   
  
   

travel-weary we come
to this haven of rest
to relax where god’s waters still flow
 
   
    

then renewed and restored
by his spirit refreshed
on our way with rejoicing we’ll go
  
 
      

in a close-knit communion
with christ as our head
and endued with god’s power from high
  
 
    


on the pathway of life
we by him will be led
knowing god all our needs will supply

may end with today
  
  
   
 

oh child of the kingdom
from sin service cease
be filled with the spirit
with comfort and peace
  
  
 
  

oh grieve not the spirit
thy teacher is he
that jesus thy saviour
may glorified be
 
  
  
 

defiled is the temple
its beauty laid low
on god’s holy altar
the embers faint glow
  
 
  
 


by love yet rekindled
a flame may be fanned
oh quench not the spirit
the lord is at hand
  
  
   
  

guide me o thou great jehovah
pilgrim through this barren land
i am weak but thou art mighty
hold me with thy pow’rful hand
bread of heaven bread of heaven
feed me till i want no more
   
   
   
    
    
     
   
open now the crystal fountain
whence the healing streams doth flow
let the fire and cloudy pillar
lead me all my journey through
strong deliv’rer strong deliv’rer
be thou still my strength and shield
   
   
   
    
   
    

when i tread the verge of jordan
bid my anxious fears subside
death of death and hell’s destruction
land me safe on canaan’s side
songs of praises songs of praises
i will ever give to thee
   
   
   
   
   
  


my jesus my saviour
lord there is none like you
all of my days i want to praise
the wonders of your mighty love
     
  
   
    
    

my comfort my shelter
tower of refuge and strength
let ev’ry breath all that i am
never cease to worship you
   
   
      
   

shout to the lord all the earth let us sing
power and majesty praise to the king
mountains bow down and the seas will roar
at the sound of your name
   
    
   
  


i sing for joy at the work of your hands
for ever i’ll love you for ever i’ll stand
nothing compares
to the promise i have in you
      
      
  
  



i lift my hands to the coming king
to the great i am
to you i sing
for you’re the one
who reigns within my heart
i lift my hands



and i will serve no foreign god
or any other treasure
you are my heart’s desire
spirit without measure
unto your name
i would bring my sacrifice


anywhere with jesus i can safely go
anywhere he leads me in this world below
anywhere without him dearest joys would fade
anywhere with jesus i am not afraid
   
     
       
      
       

anywhere anywhere
fear i cannot know
anywhere with jesus
i can safely go

   
   
     

anywhere with jesus i am not alone
other friends may fail me he is still my own
though his hand may lead me over
drearest ways
anywhere with jesus is a house of praise
       
     
      
      

anywhere anywhere
fear i cannot know
anywhere with jesus
i can safely go

   
   
     

anywhere with jesus over land and sea
telling souls in darkness of salvation free
ready as he summons me to go or stay
anywhere with jesus when he points the way
      
    
      
      

anywhere anywhere
fear i cannot know
anywhere with jesus
i can safely go

   
   
     

anywhere with jesus i can go to sleep
when the darkening shadows round about
me creep
knowing i shall waken nevermore to roam
anywhere with jesus will be home sweet home
      
      
     
      


anywhere anywhere
fear i cannot know
anywhere with jesus
i can safely go

   
   
     


o where are the reapers that garner in
the sheaves of the good from the fields of sin
with sickles of truth must the work be done
and no one may rest till the “harvest home”
   
      
      
    
     

where are the reapers o who will come
and share in the glory of the “harvest home”
o who will help us to garner in
the sheaves of good from the fields of sin

      
     
      
    

go out in the byways and search them all
the wheat may be there but the weeds are tall
then search in the highway and pass none by
but gather them all for the home on high
   
    
     
    

where are the reapers o who will come
and share in the glory of the “harvest home”
o who will help us to garner in
the sheaves of good from the fields of sin

      
     
      
    

the fields are all ripening and far and wide
the world now is waiting the harvest tide
but reapers are few and the work is great
and much will be lost should the harvest wait
      
     
    
     

where are the reapers o who will come
and share in the glory of the “harvest home”
o who will help us to garner in
the sheaves of good from the fields of sin

      
     
      
    

so come with your sickles ye sons of men
and gather together the golden grain
toil on till the lord of the harvest come
then share ye his joy in the “harvest home”
    
    
   -
     


where are the reapers o who will come

amazing grace how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me
i once was lost but now am found
was blind but now i see

’twas grace that taught my heart to fear
and grace my fears relieved
how precious did that grace appear
the hour i first believed
  amazing grace



my chains are gone i’ve been set free
my god my saviour has ransomed me
and like a flood his mercy reigns
unending love amazing grace



the lord has promised good to me
his word my hope secures
he will my shield and portion be
as long as life endures



my chains are gone i’ve been set free
my god my saviour has ransomed me
and like a flood his mercy reigns
unending love amazing grace





the earth shall soon dissolve like snow
the sun forbear to shine
but god who called me here below
will be forever mine


one day when heaven was filled with his praises
one day when sin was as black as could be
jesus came forth to be born of a virgin
dwelt among men my example is he
  

    
     
     
     

living he loved me dying he saved me
buried he carried my sins far away
rising he justified freely forever
one day he’s comingo glorious day

      
     
   
  
     

one day they led him up calvary’s mountain
one day they nailed him to die on the tree
suffering anguish despised and rejected
bearing our sins my redeemer is he

    
    
      
     

living he loved me dying he saved me
buried he carried my sins far away
rising he justified freely forever
one day he’s comingo glorious day

      
     
   
  
     

one day they left him alone in the garden
one day he rested from suffering free
angels came down o’er his tomb to keep vigil
hope of the hopeless my saviour is he

     
    
      
    

living he loved me dying he saved me
buried he carried my sins far away
rising he justified freely forever
one day he’s comingo glorious day

      
     
   
  
     

one day the grave could conceal him no longer
one day the stone rolled away from the door
then he arose over death he had conquered
now is ascended my lord evermore

   
   
    
    

living he loved me dying he saved me
buried he carried my sins far away
rising he justified freely forever
one day he’s comingo glorious day

      
     
   
  
     

one day the trumpet will sound for his coming
one day the skies with his glory will shine
wonderful day my beloved ones bringing
glorious saviour this jesus is mine

   
     
    
     


living he loved me dying he saved me
buried he carried my sins far away
rising he justified freely forever
one day he’s comingo glorious day

instil a peace and trust within my soul
amid life’s tempest stay thou o’er beside me
bring me at last to my heavenly goal

’tis the grandest theme through the ages rung
’tis the grandest theme for a mortal tongue
’tis the grandest theme that the world e’er sung
“our god is able to deliver thee”
  
     
     
      
       

he is able to deliver thee
he is able to deliver thee
though by sin oppressed go to him for rest
“our god is able to deliver thee”

’tis the grandest theme for a mortal strain
’tis the grandest theme tell the world again
“our god is able to deliver thee”
     
     
     
       

he is able to deliver thee
he is able to deliver thee
though by sin oppressed go to him for rest
“our god is able to deliver thee”

     
     
      
       

’tis the grandest theme let the tidings roll
to the guilty heart to the sinful soul
look to god in faith he will make thee whole
“our god is able to deliver thee”

great god we sing your mighty hand
by which supported still we stand
the opening year your mercy shows
that mercy crowns it ’til its close
   
   
     
    
    

by day by night at home abroad
still are we guarded by our god
by his incessant bounty fed
by his unerring counsel led
     
   
    
    

with grateful hearts the past we own
the future all to us unknown
we to thy guardian care commit
and peaceful leave before thy feet
  
      
    
   


in scenes exalted or depressed
you are our joy and you our rest
your goodness all our hopes shall raise
adored through all our changing days
      
     
    
     


i stand amazed in the presence
of jesus the nazarene
and wonder how he could love me
a sinner condemned unclean


o how marvellous o how wonderful
and my song shall ever be
o how marvellous o how wonderful
is my saviour’s love for me
i stand amazed
for me it was in the garden
he prayed “not my will but thine”
he had no tears for his own griefs
but sweat drops of blood for mine


o how marvellous o how wonderful
and my song shall ever be
o how marvellous o how wonderful
is my saviour’s love for me
in pity angels beheld him
and came from the world of light
to comfort him in the sorrows
he bore for my soul that night


o how marvellous o how wonderful
and my song shall ever be
o how marvellous o how wonderful
is my saviour’s love for me
he took my sins and my sorrows
he made them his very own
he bore the burden to calvary
and suffered and died alone


o how marvellous o how wonderful
and my song shall ever be
o how marvellous o how wonderful
is my saviour’s love for me

when with the ransomed in glory
his face i at last shall see
’twill be my joy through the ages
to sing of his love for me


o how marvellous o how wonderful
and my song shall ever be
o how marvellous o how wonderful
is my saviour’s love for me


beneath the cross of jesus
i fain would take my stand
the shadow of a mighty rock
within a weary land
  
  
  
    
   

a home within the wilderness
a rest upon the way
from the burning of the noontide heat
and the burden of the day
   
  
   
   

o safe and happy shelter
o refuge tried and sweet
o trysting place where heaven’s love
and heaven’s justice meet
  
 
     
  

as to the holy patriarch
that wondrous dream was given
so seems my saviour’s cross to me
a ladder up to heaven
    
  
    
    

upon the cross of jesus
mine eyes at times can see
the very dying form of one
who suffered there for me
   
    
  
   

and from my stricken heart with tears
two wonders i confess
the wonders of redeeming love
and my unworthiness
   
  
  
  

i take o cross thy shadow
for my abiding place
i ask no other sunshine than
the sunshine of his face
   
  
     
   


content to let the world go by
to know no gain nor loss
my sinful self my only shame
my glory all the cross
   
   
   
  


make me a captive lord
and then i shall be free
force me to render up my sword
and i shall conqueror be
   
   
     
 
  

i sink in life’s alarms
when by myself i stand
imprison me within thine arms
and strong shall be my hand
  
   
   
   

my heart is weak and poor
until its master find
it has no spring of action sure
it varies with the wind
  
  
      
  

it cannot freely move
till thou hast wrought its chain
enslave it with thy matchless love
and deathless it shall reign
   
   
   
  

my power is faint and low
till i have learned to serve
it wants the needed fire to glow
it wants the breeze to nerve
   
    
    
   

it cannot drive the world
until itself be driv’n
its flag can only be unfurled
when thou shalt breathe from heav’n
   
   
   
 

my will is not my own
till thou hast made it thine
if it would reach a monarch’s throne
it must its crown resign
   
  
     
  


it only stands unbent
amid the clashing strife
when on thy bosom it has leant
and found in thee its life
  
   
    
    


o think of the home over there
by the side of the river of light
where the saints all immortal and fair
are robed in their garments of light
-     
   
     
    
  

over there over there
o think of the home over there
over there over there
o think of the home over there

   
   
   
   

my saviour is now over there
there my kindred and friends are at rest
then away from my sorrow and care
let me fly to the land of the blest
    
    
    
    

over there over there
o think of the home over there
over there over there
o think of the home over there

   
   
   
   

i’ll soon be at home over there
for the end of my journey i see
many dear to my heart over there
are watching and waiting for me
    
   
     
    


over there over there
o think of the home over there
over there over there
o think of the home over there

but you clothed yourself
in frail humanity

you did not wait for me

but you let me hear your voice
calling me
  you did not wait for me




and i’m forever grateful to you
i’m forever grateful for the cross
i’m forever grateful to you

though naught of thy great power
may move my soul
with thee through night and darkness
i reach the goal

with a special mercy for each hour
all my cares he fain would bear and cheer me
he whose name is counsellor and pow’r
     
     
   
     
the protection of his child and treasure
is a charge that on himself he laid
“as your days your strength shall be in
measure”
this the pledge to me he made
   
     
      
   

help me then in ev’ry tribulation
so to trust your promises o lord
that i lose not faith’s sweet consolation
offered me within your holy word
   
    
   
     


help me lord when toil and trouble meeting
e’er to take as from a father’s hand
one by one the days the moments fleeting
till i reach the promised land

for the son of god who came
ruined sinners to reclaim

sealed my pardon with his blood

guilty vile and helpless we
spotless lamb of god was he
full atonement can it be

all his ransomed home to bring
then anew this song we’ll sing
hallelujah what a saviour

hopes deceive and fears annoy

he has redeemed me and i am his child
    
    
     
      
      

under his wings under his wings
who from his love can sever
under his wings my soul shall abide

under his wings what a refuge in sorrow
how the heart yearningly turns to his rest
often when earth has no balm for my healing
there i find comfort and there i am blest
    
    
     
    

under his wings under his wings
who from his love can sever
under his wings my soul shall abide
safely abide forever

     
   
     
  

under his wings o what precious enjoyment
there will i hide ’til life’s trials are o’er
sheltered protected no evil can harm me
resting in jesus i’m safe evermore
      
      
     
     


under his wings under his wings
who from his love can sever
under his wings my soul shall abide
safely abide forever

there’s a dear and precious book
though it’s worn and faded now
which recalls those happy days of long ago
when i stood at mother’s knee
with her hand upon my brow
and i heard her voice in gentle tones and low
     
   
  
   
   
  
      


blessd book precious book
on thy dear old tear stained leaves i love to look
thou art sweeter day by day
as i walk the narrow way
that leads at last to that bright home above

   
    
    
   
      

then she read of jesus’ love
as he blessed the children dear
how he suffered bled and died upon the tree
of his heavy load of care
then she dried my flowing tears
with her kisses as she said it was for me
  
   
      
    
    
     


blessd book precious book
on thy dear old tear stained leaves i love to look
thou art sweeter day by day
as i walk the narrow way

well those days are past and gone
but their memory lingers still
and the dear old book each day has been
my guide
and i seek to do his will
as my mother taught me then
and ever in my heart his words abide

there’s a church in the valley
by the wildwood

to the trees where the wild flowers
bloom
where the farewell hymn will be chanted
i shall rest by her side in the tomb

to list’n to the clear ringing bell
its tones so sweetly are calling

oh come to the church in the vale
no spot is so dear to my childhood
as the little brown church in the vale

     
      
   
   
from the church in the valley
by the wildwood
when day fades away into night
i would fain from this spot of my
childhood
wing my way to the mansions of light

and the powers of nature fade
still will i sing through death’s cold shade

jesus keep me near the cross
there a precious fountain
free to all a healing stream
flows from calvary’s mountain
   
   
 
   
   

in the cross in the cross
be my glory ever
’til my raptured soul shall find
rest beyond the river

   
   
  
  

near the cross a trembling soul
love and mercy found me
there the bright and morning star
shed its beams around me
   
  
   
  

in the cross in the cross
be my glory ever
’til my raptured soul shall find
rest beyond the river

   
   
  
  

near the cross o lamb of god
bring its scenes before me
help me walk from day to day
with its shadows o’er me
   
  
    
  

in the cross in the cross
be my glory ever
’til my raptured soul shall find
rest beyond the river

   
   
  
  

near the cross i’ll watch and wait
hoping trusting ever
’til i reach the golden strand
just beyond the river
    
   
   
  


in the cross in the cross
be my glory ever
’til my raptured soul shall find
rest beyond the river

help my unbelief
  
  
    
 

saviour saviour
hear my humble cry
while on others thou art calling

trusting only in thy merit
would i seek thy face
heal my wounded broken spirit
save me by thy grace

not now but in the coming years
it may be in the better land
we’ll read the meaning of our tears
and there some time we’ll understand
-    
-    
      
  
  

then trust in god through all the days
fear not for he doth hold thy hand
though dark thy way still sing and praise
some time some time we’ll understand

  
    
    
      

we’ll catch the broken thread again
and finish what we here began
heav’n will the mysteries explain
and then ah then we’ll understand
  
  
   
    

then trust in god through all the days
fear not for he doth hold thy hand
though dark thy way still sing and praise
some time some time we’ll understand

  
    
    
      

we’ll know why clouds instead of sun
were over many a cherished plan
why song has ceased when scarce begun
’tis there some time we’ll understand
   
     
    
    

then trust in god through all the days
fear not for he doth hold thy hand
though dark thy way still sing and praise
some time some time we’ll understand

  
    
    
      

god knows the way he holds the key
he guides us with unerring hand
some time with tearless eyes we’ll see
yes there up there we’ll understand
     
     
     
      


then trust in god through all the days
fear not for he doth hold thy hand
though dark thy way still sing and praise
some time some time we’ll understand

  
    
    
      


while shepherds watched their flocks
by night
all seated on the ground
the angel of the lord came down
and glory shone around

“fear not” said he for mighty dread
had seized their troubled mind
“glad tidings of great joy i bring
to you and all mankind
  while shepherds watched

“to you in david’s town this day
is born of david’s line
a saviour who is christ the lord
and this shall be the sign

“the heav’nly babe you there shall find
to human view displayed
all meanly wrapped in swathing bands
and in a manger laid”


thus spake the seraph and forthwith
appeared a shining throng
of angels praising god who thus
addressed their joyful song

“all glory be to god on high
and to the earth be peace
goodwill henceforth from heav’n to earth
begin and never cease”



ascribe greatness
to our god the rock
his work is perfect
and all his ways are just

a god of faithfulness and
without injustice
good and upright is he
  ascribe greatness



i love you lord
and i lift my voice
to worship you
o my soul rejoice

take joy my king
in what you hear
may it be a sweet

his spirit only can bestow
who reigns in light above

thy heart made truly his
who dwells in cloudless light enshrined
in whom no darkness is
    
    
   
     

walk in the light and thou shalt own
thy darkness passed away
because that light hath on thee shone
in which is perfect day
    
  
    
   

walk in the light and e’en the tomb
no fearful shade shall wear
glory shall chase away its gloom
for christ has conquered there
    
  
     
    


walk in the light and thine shall be
a path though thorny bright
for god by grace shall dwell in thee
and god himself is light

and you rose again on high
and you opened the way
for the world to live again

who will bear the sheaves away”
   
   
  
    
    

long and loud the master calls us
rich reward he offers free
who will answer gladly saying
“here am i send me send me”
  
   
   
   

if you cannot cross the ocean
and the distant lands explore
you can find the lost around you
you can help them at your door
  
   
      
  

if you cannot give your thousands
you can give the widow’s mite
what you truly give for jesus
will be precious in his sight
   
  
   
   

if you cannot speak like angels
if you cannot preach like paul
you can tell the love of jesus
you can say he died for all
  
   
   
    

if you cannot rouse the wicked
with the judgement’s dread alarms
you can lead the little children
to the saviour’s waiting arms
   
     
   
   

let none hear you idly saying
“there is nothing i can do”
while the lost of earth are dying
and the master calls for you
    
  
     
  


take the task he gives you gladly
let his work your pleasure be
answer quickly when he calls you
“here am i send me send me”

in christ alone my hope is found
he is my light my strength my song
this cornerstone this solid ground
firm through the fiercest drought and storm

what heights of love what depths of peace
when fears are stilled when strivings cease
my comforter my all in all
here in the love of christ i stand
  in christ alone

in christ alonewho took on flesh
fullness of god in helpless babe
this gift of love and righteousness
scorned by the ones he came to save

till on the cross as jesus died
the wrath of god was satisfied
for ev’ry sin on him was laid
here in the death of christ i live

there in the ground his body lay
light of the world by darkness slain
then bursting forth in glorious day
up from the grave he rose again

and as he stands in victory
sin’s curse has lost its grip on me
for i am his and he is mine
bought with the precious blood of christ


no guilt in life no fear in death
this is the pow’r of christ in me
from life’s first cry to final breath
jesus commands my destiny

no pow’r of hell no scheme of man
can ever pluck me from his hand
till he returns or calls me home
here in the pow’r of christ i’ll stand


jesus is coming to earth again
what if it were today
coming in power and love to reign
what if it were today
   
    
   
    
   

coming to claim his chosen bride
all the redeemed and purified
over this whole earth scattered wide
what if it were today

glory glory
when we shall crown him king

 
   
 
   

glory glory
haste to prepare the way
glory glory
jesus will come some day
 
   
 
   

satan’s dominion will then be o’er
o that it were today
sorrow and sighing shall be no more
o that it were today
   
    
   
    

then shall the dead in christ arise
caught up to meet him in the skies
when shall these glories meet our eyes
what if it were today
   
    
   
   

glory glory
joy to my heart ’twill bring
glory glory
when we shall crown him king

faithful and true would he find us here
if he should come today
watching in gladness and not in fear

signs of his coming multiply
morning light breaks in eastern sky
watch for the time is drawing nigh
what if it were today

borne in a song to me
over the fields of glory

safe on his gentle breast
there by his love o’ershaded
sweetly my soul shall rest

   
   
    
    




it’s your blood that cleanses me
it’s your blood that gives me life
it’s your blood that took my place
in redeeming sacrifice
and washes me whiter than the snow
than the snow
my jesus god’s precious sacrifice
it’s your blood


must jesus bear the cross alone
and all the world go free
no there’s a cross for everyone
and there’s a cross for me
    
     
    
   
   

how happy are the saints above
who once went sorrowing here
but now they taste unmingled love
and joy without a tear
   
  
    
  

the consecrated cross i’ll bear
till death shall set me free
and then go home my crown to wear
for there’s a crown for me
   
   
    
    

upon the crystal pavement down
at jesus’ piercd feet
joyful i’ll cast my golden crown
and his dear name repeat
   
  
    
   

o precious cross o glorious crown
o resurrection day
when christ the lord
from heav’n comes down
and bears my soul away
     ― 
   
    
    


i was sinking deep in sin
far from the peaceful shore
very deeply stained within
sinking to rise no more
     
   
    
  
  

but the master of the sea
heard my despairing cry
from the waters lifted me
now safe am i
   
  
    
  

love lifted me
love lifted me
when nothing else could help
love lifted me

 
 
   
 

all my heart to him i give
ever to him i’ll cling
in his blessed presence live
ever his praises sing
  
    
   
  

love so mighty and so true
merits my soul’s best songs
faithful loving service too
to him belongs
    
  
   
  

love lifted me
love lifted me
when nothing else could help
love lifted me

 
 
   
 

souls in danger look above
jesus completely saves
he will lift you by his love
out of the angry waves
 
  
  
  

he’s the master of the sea
billows his will obey
he your saviour wants to be
be saved today
     
  
    
  


love lifted me
love lifted me
when nothing else could help
love lifted me  

 
 
   
   


though i may speak with
the language of angels
and though i may fathom
all mysteries

see into the future
have faith that moves mountains
if i am without love
then what does it mean
  though i may speak



without love
it’s nothing at all
without love
without love
it’s nothing at all

and even if i gave
the poor my possessions
surrendered my body
and died for the cause

though highly respected
successful and gifted
if love was excluded
i’ve wasted it all



without love
it’s nothing at all
without love
without love
it’s nothing at all

and when we pass through the fire
nothing but love will survive


without love
it’s nothing at all
without love
without love
it’s nothing at all




and with you
jesus we see love
nothing but love will survive

heal me o lord
and i will be healed
save me and i will be saved

heal me o lord
and i will be healed
for you are the one i praise
you are the one i praise
  heal me o lord


o that i had a thousand voices
and with a thousand tongues could tell
of him in whom the earth rejoices
who does all things wisely and well
      
      
   
   
    

my grateful heart would then be free
to tell what god has done for me
     
       
o all you pow’rs that god implanted
arise and silence keep no more
put forth the strength that god has
granted
your noblest work is to adore
      
    
     
     

o soul and body join to raise
with heartfelt joy our maker’s praise
    
   

you forest leaves so green and tender
that dance for joy in summer air
you meadow grasses bright and slender
you flow’rs so wond’rous sweet so fair
   
  
    
     

you live to show god’s praise alone
with me now make his glory known
   
    
all creatures that have breath and
motion
that throng the earth the sea the sky
now join with me my heart’s devotion
help me to raise his praises high
    
   
    
    

my utmost pow’rs can ne’er aright
declare the wonders of god’s might
    
    
   
  
     
  

o father deign thou i beseech thee
to listen to my earthly lays
a nobler strain in heav’n shall reach thee
when i with angels hymn thy praise

    
    

and learn amid their choirs to sing
loud hallelujahs to my king


love divine all loves excelling
joy of heav’n to earth come down
fix in us thy humble dwelling
all thy faithful mercies crown
   
 
  
    
    

jesus thou art all compassion
pure unbounded love thou art
visit us with thy salvation
enter ev’ry trembling heart
   
  
    
   

breathe o breathe thy loving spirit
into ev’ry troubled breast
let us all in thee inherit
let us find thy promised rest
   
   
  
  

take away our bent to sinning
alpha and omega be
end of faith as its beginning
set our hearts at liberty
    
  
   
   

come almighty to deliver
let us all thy life receive
suddenly return and never
nevermore thy temples leave
   
   
  
   

thee we would be always blessing
serve thee as thy hosts above
pray and praise thee without ceasing
glory in thy perfect love
    
    
  
  

finish then thy new creation
pure and spotless let us be
let us see thy great salvation
perfectly restored in thee
   
 
    
  


changed from glory into glory
’til in heav’n we take our place
till we cast our crowns before thee
lost in wonder love and praise
    
   
   
 


“almost persuaded”
now to believe
“almost persuaded”
christ to receive
 
 
  
  
 

seems now some soul to say
“go spirit go thy way
some more convenient day
on thee i’ll call”
 -  
  
   
  

“almost persuaded”
come come today
“almost persuaded”
turn not away
  
  
  
  

jesus invites you here
angels are lingering near
prayers rise from hearts so dear
o wanderer come
  
  
   
 

“almost persuaded”
harvest is past
“almost persuaded”
doom comes at last
  
 
  
 


“almost” cannot avail
“almost” is but to fail
sad sad that bitter wail
“almost” but lost
   
  
   
  


an open bible for the world
may this our glorious motto be
on ev’ry breeze its flag unfurled
shall scatter blessings rich and free
  
  
     
    
   

blest word of god send forth thy light
o’er every land and every sea
till all who wander in the night
are led to god and heaven by thee

    
    
    
   

where’er it goes its golden light
streaming as from an unveiled sun
shall dissipate the clouds of night
undo the work that sin has done
   
   
    
    

blest word of god send forth thy light
o’er every land and every sea
till all who wander in the night
are led to god and heaven by thee

    
    
    
   

it shows to men the father’s face
all radiant with forgiving love
and to the lost of adam’s race
proclaims sweet mercy from above
  
    
   
   

blest word of god send forth thy light
o’er every land and every sea
till all who wander in the night
are led to god and heaven by thee

    
    
    
   

it offers rest to weary hearts
it comforts those who sit in tears
to all who faint it strength imparts
and gilds with hope th’ eternal years
    
    
     
  


blest word of god send forth thy light
o’er every land and every sea
till all who wander in the night
are led to god and heaven by thee

as news of your impending death
to your disciples broke
and lovingly you took the bread
and words of blessing spoke
-    
  
   
  ’  
  
the bread you broke and with these
words
distributed to all
“this is my bodytake and eat
partake of it all of you”
  
  
„      
  ”

and then o lord you took the cup
and prayed and then you said
“this is my bloodby it for sins
atonement will be made”
     
„   
  ”   
„    ”

“this is the covenant of blood
no other can there be
whene’er you do it do it in
remembrance friends of me”
„     
   
    
   ”

your blood we would remember lord
for us shed on the tree
your mutilated body too
o let us ever see
    
    
    
    


possess our thoughts that ever we
may seek the reason why
why you on calv’ry’s rugged cross
chose such a death to die
    
   
     
  


on a hill far away
stood an old rugged cross
the emblem of suffering and shame
and i love that old cross
where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain
  

      
    
      
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

     
    
      
     

oh that old rugged cross
so despised by the world
has a wondrous attraction for me
for the dear lamb of god left his glory above
to bear it to dark calvary
       
      
       
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

     
    
      
     

to the old rugged cross i will ever be true
it’s shame and reproach gladly bear
then he’ll call me some day
to my home far away
where his glory forever i’ll share
       
   
      
    


so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

     
    
      
     


i grieved my lord from day to day
i scorned his love so full and free
and though i wandered far away
my mother’s prayers have followed me
   
   
    
     
  

i’m coming home i’m coming home
to live my wasted life anew
for mother’s prayers have followed me
have followed me the whole world thro’

    
   
     
  

o’er desert wild o’er mountain high
a wanderer i chose to be
a wretched soul condemned to die
still mother’s prayers have followed me
     
     
  
  

i’m coming home i’m coming home
to live my wasted life anew
for mother’s prayers have followed me
have followed me the whole world thro’

    
   
     
  

he turned my darkness into light
this blessd christ of calvary
i’ll praise his name both day and night
that mother’s prayers have followed me
    
    
    
  


i’m coming home i’m coming home
to live my wasted life anew
for mother’s prayers have followed me
have followed me the whole world thro’

    
   
     
  


i love to think of the heavenly land
where white-robed angels are
where many a friend is gathered safe
from fear and toil and care
    
    
  
    
  

there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting there

  
  
  
   

i love to think of the heavenly land
where my redeemer reigns
where rapturous songs of triumph rise
in endless joyous strains
    
   
    
  

there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting there

  
  
  
   
i love to think of the heavenly land
the saints’ eternal home
where palms and robes and crowns
ne’er fade
and all our joys are one
    
  
    
  

there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting there

  
  
  
   

i love to think of the heavenly land
that promised land so fair
oh how my raptured spirit longs
to be forever there
    
   
   
   


there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting
there’ll be no parting there

  
  
  
   


i know not why god’s wond’rous grace
to me he hath made known
nor why unworthy christ in love
redeemed me for his own
   
   
  
   
    

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

      
     
    
    

i know not how this saving faith
to me he did impart
nor how believing in his word
wrought peace within my heart
     
   
     
 

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

      
     
    
    

i know not how the spirit moves
convincing men of sin
revealing jesus through the word
creating faith in him
     
   
    
  

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

      
     
    
    

i know not what of good or ill
may be reserved for me
of weary ways or golden days
before his face i see
      
 
     
  

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

      
     
    
    

i know not when my lord may come
at night or noonday fair
nor if i’ll walk the vale with him
or meet him in the air
    
  
      
    


but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

i’m but a stranger here
heav’n is my home
earth is a desert drear
heav’n is my home
    
    
   
   
   

danger and sorrow stand
round me on every hand
heav’n is my fatherland
heav’n is my home
   
    
   
   

what though the tempest rage
heav’n is my home
short is my pilgrimage
heav’n is my home
   
   
   
   

time’s cold and wild wintry blast
soon shall be over past
i shall reach home at last
heav’n is my home
    
   
    
   

there at my saviour’s side
heav’n is my home
i shall be glorified
heav’n is my home
   
   
   
   

there are the good and blest
those i loved most and best
there too i soon shall rest
heav’n is my home
  
 
  
   

therefore i murmur not
heav’n is my home
whate’er my earthly lot
heav’n is my home
    
   
    
   


and i shall surely stand
there at my lord’s right hand
heav’n is my fatherland
heav’n is my home
   
   
  
   


better than the riches of this world
better than the sound of my friends’ voices
better than the biggest dreams in my heart
that’s just the start

better than getting what i say i need
better than living the life that i want to
better than the love anyone could give
your love is
  better than the riches

you hold me now in your arms
and never let me go


you o lord make the sunshine
and the moonlight in the night sky
you give me breath and all your love
i give my heart to you
because i can’t stop falling in love
with you
i’ll never stop falling in love with you


o zion haste thy mission high fulfilling
to tell to all the world that god is light
that he who made all nations is not willing
one soul should perish lost in shades of night
 
    
       
    
     

publish glad tidings
tidings of peace
tidings of jesus
redemption and release

 
  
 
  

behold how many thousands still are lying
bound in the darksome prison-house of sin
with none to tell them of the saviour’s dying
or of the life he died for them to win
   
      
     
    

publish glad tidings
tidings of peace
tidings of jesus
redemption and release

 
  
 
  

proclaim to every people tongue and nation
that god in whom they live and move is love
tell how he stooped to save his lost creation
and died on earth that we might live above
    
      
    
     

publish glad tidings
tidings of peace
tidings of jesus
redemption and release

 
  
 
  

give of thy sons to bear the message glorious
give of thy wealth to speed them on their way
pour out thy soul for them in prayer victorious
o zion haste to bring the brighter day
      
    
      
     


publish glad tidings
tidings of peace
tidings of jesus
redemption and release

when i survey the wondrous cross
on which the prince of glory died
my richest gain i count but loss
and pour contempt on all my pride
   
   
     
   
   

forbid it lord that i should boast
save in the death of christ my god
all the vain things that charm me most
i sacrifice them to his blood
    
     
     
   

see from his head his hands his feet
sorrow and love flow mingled down
did e’er such love and sorrow meet
or thorns compose so rich a crown
   
     
   
   


were the whole realm of nature mine
that were a present far too small
love so amazing so divine
demands my soul my life my all

it’s a song of joy no one can take away

jesus taught us how to live in harmony
different faces different races
he made us one
jesus taught us how to live in harmony

loving one another with the love
that he gives
jesus taught us how to be a family

jesus turned our sorrow into dancing
jesus turned our sorrow into dancing
changed our tears of sadness into
rivers of joy
jesus turned our sorrow into a dance


crown him with many crowns
the lamb upon his throne
hark how the heavenly anthem drowns
all music but its own
  
  
   
   
  

awake my soul and sing
of him who died for thee
and hail him as thy matchless king
through all eternity
   
   
 ―   
 ―   

crown him the lord of love
behold his hands and side
rich wounds yet visible above
in beauty glorified
  
  
    
    

no angel in the sky
can fully bear that sight
but downward bends his wondering eye
at mysteries so bright
  
   
   
     

crown him the lord of life
who triumphed o’er the grave
who rose victorious to the strife
for those he came to save
  
  
    
  

his glories now we sing
who died and rose on high
who died eternal life to bring
and lives that death may die
   
  ―   
     
    

crown him the lord of heaven
one with the father known
one with the spirit through him given
from yonder glorious throne
  
  
    
   


all hail redeemer hail
for thou hast died for me
thy praise and glory shall not fail
throughout eternity

alas and did my saviour bleed
and did my sovereign die
would he devote that sacred head
for sinners such as i
   
   
 
  
   

at the cross at the cross
where i first saw the light
and the burden of my heart rolled away
it was there by faith i received my sight
and now i am happy all the day

   
  
     
    
     


thy body slain sweet jesus thine
and bathed in its own blood
while the firm mark of wrath divine
his soul in anguish stood
   
   
    
  

at the cross at the cross
where i first saw the light
and the burden of my heart rolled away
it was there by faith i received my sight
and now i am happy all the day

   
  
     
    
     


well might the sun in darkness hide
and shut his glories in
when christ the mighty maker died
for man the creature’s sin
     
  
  
   

at the cross at the cross
where i first saw the light
and the burden of my heart rolled away
it was there by faith i received my sight
and now i am happy all the day

   
  
     
    
     


thus might i hide my blushing face
while his dear cross appears
dissolve my heart in thankfulness
and melt my eyes to tears
    
   
    
  

at the cross at the cross
where i first saw the light
and the burden of my heart rolled away
it was there by faith i received my sight
and now i am happy all the day

   
  
     
    
     


but drops of grief can ne’er repay
the debt of love i owe
here lord i give my self away
’tis all that i can do
     
   
    
   


at the cross at the cross

consider all the worlds thy hands have made
i see the stars i hear the rolling thunder
thy pow’r throughout the universe displayed
   
      
      
      
    

then sings my soul my saviour god to thee
how great thou art how great thou art
then sings my soul my saviour god to thee
how great thou art how great thou art

     
     
     
     

when through the woods
and forest glades i wander
and hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees
when i look down from lofty mountain grandeur
and hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze
    
  
    
      
    

then sings my soul my saviour god to thee
how great thou art how great thou art

and when i think that god his son not sparing
sent him to die i scarce can take it in
that on the cross my burden gladly bearing
he bled and died to take away my sin
     
      
      
    

then sings my soul my saviour god to thee
how great thou art how great thou art

from care he sets me free

and i know he watches me

i sing because i’m free
for his eye is on the sparrow

still still with thee when purple morning
breaketh
when the bird waketh and the shadows flee
fairer than morning lovelier than daylight
dawns the sweet consciousness i am with thee
  
    
 
    
      
     

alone with thee amid the mystic shadows
the solemn hush of nature newly born
alone with thee in breathless adoration
in the calm dew and freshness of the morn
     
     
     
      

still still with thee as to each newborn morning
a fresh and solemn splendour still is given
so does this blessd consciousness awaking
breath each day nearness unto thee
and heaven

break thou the bread of life
dear lord to me
as thou didst break the loaves
beside the sea
    
  
 
  


beyond the sacred page
i seek thee lord
my spirit pants for thee
o living word
   
 
   
   

bless thou the truth dear lord
to me to me
as thou didst bless the bread
by galilee
 
 
  
 

then shall all bondage cease
all fetters fall
and i shall find my peace
my all in all
  
  
    
 

o send thy spirit lord
now unto me
that he may touch my eyes
and make me see
   
  
   
 

show me the truth concealed
within thy word
for in thy book revealed
i see thee lord
   
 
    
 

thou art the bread of life
o lord to me
thy holy word the truth
that saveth me
    
  
 
 


give me to eat and live
with thee above
teach me to love thy truth
for thou art love

you led me to the cross
and i saw your face of mercy
in that place of love
you opened up my eyes
to believe your sweet salvation
where i’d been so blind

now that i’m living
in your all-forgiving love
my every road leads to the cross
  you led me to the cross



jesus keep me near the cross
i won’t forget the love you’ve shown
saviour teach me of the cross
i won’t forget the love
i won’t forget the love you’ve shown
and there’s an empty tomb
that tells me of your resurrection
and my life in you
the stone lies rolled away
nothing but those folded grave-clothes
where your body lay

now that i’m living
as a risen child of god
my every road leads to the cross




jesus keep me near the cross
i won’t forget the love you’ve shown
saviour teach me of the cross
i won’t forget the love
i won’t forget the love you’ve shown


does jesus care when my heart is pained
too deeply for mirth and song
as the burdens press and the cares
distress
and the way grows weary and long

with a nameless dread and fear

o yes he cares i know he cares
his heart is touched with my grief
when the days are weary
the long nights dreary
i know my saviour cares

     
   
       
    


does jesus care when i’ve tried and failed
to resist some temptation strong
when for my deep grief i find no relief
though my tears flow all the night long
      
    
      
    

o yes he cares i know he cares
his heart is touched with my grief
when the days are weary
the long nights dreary
i know my saviour cares

     
   
       
    

does jesus care when i’ve said goodbye
to the dearest on earth to me
and my sad heart aches till it nearly
breaks
is it aught to him does he see
      
   
     
      


o yes he cares i know he cares
his heart is touched with my grief
when the days are weary
the long nights dreary
i know my saviour cares

as news of your impending death
to your disciples broke
and lovingly you took the bread
and words of blessing spoke
  
  
   
     
  
the bread you broke and with these
words
distributed to all
“this is my bodytake and eat
partake of it all of you”
    
   
   
   

and then o lord you took the cup
and prayed and then you said
“this is my bloodby it for sins
atonement will be made”
     
    
     
   

“this is the covenant of blood
no other can there be
whene’er you do it do it in
remembrance friends of me”
     
   
   
  

your blood we would remember lord
for us shed on the tree
your mutilated body too
o let us ever see
     
  
  
    


possess our thoughts that ever we
may seek the reason why
why you on calv’ry’s rugged cross
chose such a death to die
     
    
     
  


i gave my life for thee
my precious blood i shed
that thou might’st ransomed be
and quickened from the dead
-     
   
   
  
  

i gave i gave my life for thee
what hast thou giv’n for me
i gave i gave my life for thee
what hast thou giv’n for me
   
    
   
    

my father’s house of light
my glory-circled throne
i left for earthly night
for wand’rings sad and lone
   
   
    
   

i left i left it all for thee
hast thou left aught for me
i left i left it all for thee
hast thou left aught for me
    
    
    
    

i suffered much for thee
more than thy tongue can tell
of bitt’rest agony
to rescue thee from hell
  
   
  
  

i’ve borne i’ve borne it all for thee
what hast thou borne for me
i’ve borne i’ve borne it all for thee
what hast thou borne for me
    
    
    
    

and i have brought to thee
down from my home above
salvation full and free
my pardon and my love
  
  
   
  

i bring i bring rich gifts to thee
what hast thou brought to me
i bring i bring rich gifts to thee
what hast thou brought to me

when the sun’s last rays are gleaming
bid them gather everywhere

come thou fount of every blessing
tune my heart to sing thy grace
streams of mercy never ceasing
call for songs of loudest praise
   
   
     
   
   

teach me some melodious sonnet
sung by flaming tongues above
praise the mount i’m fixed upon it
mount of god’s unchanging love
    
   
  
  

here i raise my ebenezer
hither by thy help i come
and i hope by thy good pleasure
safely to arrive at home
   -
   
     
    

jesus sought me when a stranger
wand’ring from the fold of god
he to rescue me from danger
interposed his precious blood
    
   
  
  

oh to grace how great a debtor
daily i’m constrained to be
let thy grace lord like a fetter
bind my wand’ring heart to thee
   
   
  
   


prone to wander lord i feel it
prone to leave the god i love
here’s my heart lord take and seal it
seal it for thy courts above
   
   
   
  


at even ere the sun was set
the sick o lord around thee lay
o with how many pains they met
o with what joy they went away
  
     
   
   
  

once more ’tis eventide and we
oppressed with various ills draw near
what if thyself we cannot see
we know that thou art ever near
     
    
    
     

o saviour christ our woes dispel
for some are sick and some are sad
and some have never loved thee well
and some have lost the love they had
   
    
   
    

o saviour christ thou too art man
thou has been troubled tempted tried
thy kind but searching glance can scan
the very wounds that shame would hide
     
    
   
     


thy touch has still its ancient power
no word from thee can fruitless fall
hear in this solemn evening hour
and in thy mercy heal us all

when sorrows like sea billows roll
whatever my lot thou hast taught me to say
“it is well it is well with my soul”
   
     
    
    
    


it is well it is well
with my soul with my soul
it is well it is well with my soul

     
   
    
though satan should buffet
though trials should come
let blessed assurance control
that christ hath regarded my helpless estate
and has shed his own blood for my soul
     
   
      
   


it is well it is well
with my soul with my soul
it is well it is well with my soul

     
   
    

my sin o the bliss of this glorious thought
my sin not in part but the whole
is nailed to the cross and i bear it no more
praise the lord praise the lord o my soul
      
     
      
  


it is well it is well
with my soul with my soul
it is well it is well with my soul

     
   
    

for me be it christ be it christ hence to live
if jordan above me shall roll
no pang shall be mine for in death as in life
thou wilt whisper thy peace to my soul
       
     
     
    


it is well it is well
with my soul with my soul
it is well it is well with my soul

     
   
    
o lord haste the day when my faith
shall be sight
the clouds be rolled back as a scroll
the trump shall resound and the lord
shall descend
“even so” it is well with my soul
    
   
      
    



it is well it is well
with my soul with my soul
it is well it is well with my soul

on a hill far away
stood an old rugged cross
the emblem of suffering and shame
and i love that old cross
where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain
-    

      
     
      
      

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

     
    
     
     

oh that old rugged cross
so despised by the world
has a wondrous attraction for me
for the dear lamb of god left his glory above
to bear it to dark calvary
      

     
       

     

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

     
    
     
     
in that old rugged cross
stained with blood so divine
a wondrous beauty i see
for ’twas on that old cross
jesus suffered and died
to pardon and sanctify me
       
    
      
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

     
    
     
     

to the old rugged cross i will ever be true
it’s shame and reproach gladly bear
then he’ll call me some day
to my home far away
where his glory forever i’ll share

o holy night the stars are brightly shining
it is the night of the dear saviour’s birth
long lay the world in sin and error pining
till he appeared and the soul felt its worth
 
    
     
      
     

a thrill of hope the weary soul rejoices
for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
fall on your knees o hear the angel voices
o night divine o night when christ was born
o night o holy night o night divine
   
    
     
     
     

led by the light of faith serenely beaming
with glowing hearts by his cradle we stand
so led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
here came the wise men from orient land
    
       
    
      
the king of kings lay thus in lowly manger
in all our trials born to be our friend
he knows our needto our weakness is
no stranger
behold your king before him lowly bend
behold your king before him lowly bend
      
     
     
     
     

truly he taught us to love one another
his law is love and his gospel is peace
chains shall he break for the slave is
our brother
and in his name all oppression shall cease
     
       
     
     


sweet hymns of joy in grateful  raise we
let all within us praise his holy name
christ is the lord o praise his name forever
his pow’r and glory evermore proclaim
his pow’r and glory evermore proclaim

come holy spirit heavenly dove
with all thy quick’ning powers
kindle a flame of sacred love
in these cold hearts of ours
   
     
  
    
  

in vain we tune our formal songs
in vain we strive to rise
hosannas languish on our tongues
and our devotion dies
   
  
     
  

dear lord and shall we ever live
at this poor dying rate
our love so faint so cold to thee
and thine to us so great
   
   
     
    


come holy spirit heavenly dove
with all thy quick’ning powers
come shed abroad the saviour’s love
and that shall kindle ours
     
   
    
   


o worship the king all glorious above
and gratefully sing his pow’r and his love
our shield and defender the ancient of days
pavilioned in splendour and girded with praise
    
   
      
     
   
o tell of his might and sing of his grace
whose robe is the light whose canopy space
his chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds
form
and dark is his path on the wings of the storm
    
      
      
   
thy bountiful care what tongue can recite
it breathes in the air it shines in the light
it streams from the hills it descends to
the plain
and sweetly distils in the dew and the rain
    
      
       
     


frail children of dust and feeble as frail
in thee do we trust nor find thee to fail
thy mercies how tender how firm to the end
our maker defender redeemer and friend

a mighty fortress is our god
a bulwark never failing
our helper he amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing
    
    
    
     
    
for still our ancient foe
doth seek to work us woe
his craft and power are great
and armed with cruel hate
on earth is not his equal
    
  
   
   
    

did we in our own strength confide
our striving would be losing
were not the right man on our side
the man of god’s own choosing
   
  
    
  
dost ask who that may be
christ jesus it is he
lord sabaoth his name
from age to age the same
and he must win the battle
   
  
    
       
 

and though this world with devils filled
should threaten to undo us
we will not fear for god hath willed
his truth to triumph through us
   
   
   
  
the prince of darkness grim
we tremble not for him
his rage we can endure
for lo his doom is sure
one little word shall fell him
    
   
   
   
  

that word above all earthly powers
no thanks to them abideth
the spirit and the gifts are ours
through him who with us sideth
  
   
   
 

let goods and kindred go
this mortal life also
the body they may kill
god’s truth abideth still
his kingdom is forever

when i was but a little child
how well i recollect
how i would grieve my mother
with my folly and neglect
    
    
  
    
  

and now that she has gone to heav’n
i miss her tender care
o saviour tell my mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there
    
   
  
     

tell mother i’ll be there
in answer to her prayer
this message blessd saviour
to her bear

   
  
 
  

tell mother i’ll be there
heav’n’s joys with her to share
yes tell my darling mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there
   
     
  
     

though i was often wayward
she was always kind and good
so patient gentle loving
when i acted rough and rude
   
    
    
  

my childhood griefs and trials
she would gladly with me share
o saviour tell my mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there
   
 
  
     

tell mother i’ll be there
in answer to her prayer
this message blessd saviour
to her bear

   
  
 
  

tell mother i’ll be there
heav’n’s joys with her to share
yes tell my darling mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there
   
     
  
     

when i became a prodigal
and left the old roof-tree
she almost broke her loving heart
in mourning after me
    
    
   
   

and day and night she prayed to god
to keep me in his care
o saviour tell my mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there
     
   
  
     

tell mother i’ll be there
in answer to her prayer
this message blessd saviour
to her bear

   
  
 
  

tell mother i’ll be there
heav’n’s joys with her to share
yes tell my darling mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there
   
     
  
     

one day a message came to me
it bade me quickly come
if i would see my mother
ere the saviour took her home
    
   
   
   

i promised her before she died
for heaven to prepare
o saviour tell my mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there
     
  
  
     

tell mother i’ll be there
in answer to her prayer
this message blessd saviour
to her bear

   
  
 
  


tell mother i’ll be there
heav’n’s joys with her to share
yes tell my darling mother
i’ll be there i’ll be there

i will never be
the same again
i can never return
i’ve closed the door

i will walk the path
i’ll run the race
and i will never be the same again
i will never be the same

fall like fire
soak like rain
flow like mighty waters
again and again

sweep away the darkness
burn away the chaff
and let a flame burn
to glorify your name


there are higher heights
there are deeper seas
whatever you need to do
lord do in me

the glory of god fills my life
and i will never be the same again
and i will never be the same again


it’s our confession lord
that we are weak
so very weak
but you are strong

and though we’ve nothing lord
to lay at your feet
we come to your feet
and say “help us along”
it’s our confession lord


a broken heart and a contrite spirit
you have yet to deny
your heart of mercy beats
with love’s strong current
let the river flow by your spirit now
lord we cry




let your mercies fall from heaven
sweet mercies flow from heaven
new mercies for today
o shower them down lord
as we pray




to god be the glory
to god be the glory
to god be the glory
for the things he has done

with his blood he has saved me
with his pow’r he has raised me

o christ in thee my soul hath found
and found in thee alone
the peace the joy i sought so long
the bliss till now unknown

there’s a church in the valley
by the wildwood
no lovelier spot in the dale
no place is so dear to my childhood
as the little brown church in the vale
-     

    
     
     
  

come to the church in the wildwood
oh come to the church in the vale
no spot is so dear to my childhood
as the little brown church in the vale

     
     
   
   

how sweet on a clear sabbath morning
to list’n to the clear ringing bell
its tones so sweetly are calling
oh come to the church in the vale
   
    
   
   

come to the church in the wildwood
oh come to the church in the vale
no spot is so dear to my childhood
as the little brown church in the vale

     
     
   
   
there close by the church in the valley
lies one that i loved so well
she sleeps sweetly sleeps ’neath
the willow
disturb not her rest in the vale
      
    
   
    

come to the church in the wildwood
oh come to the church in the vale
no spot is so dear to my childhood
as the little brown church in the vale

     
     
   
   
there close by the side of that loved one
to the trees where the wild flowers
bloom
where the farewell hymn will be chanted
i shall rest by her side in the tomb
   
    
   
 ―   

come to the church in the wildwood
oh come to the church in the vale
no spot is so dear to my childhood
as the little brown church in the vale

     
     
   
   
from the church in the valley
by the wildwood
when day fades away into night
i would fain from this spot of my
childhood
wing my way to the mansions of light

    
    
  
    


come to the church in the wildwood
oh come to the church in the vale
no spot is so dear to my childhood
as the little brown church in the vale

     
     
   
   



i enter the holy of holies
i enter through the blood of the lamb
i enter to worship you only
i enter to honour “i am”

lord i worship you i worship you

for your name is holy holy lord

i come to the garden alone
while the dew is still on the roses
and the voice i hear falling on my ear
the son of god discloses
     
     
   
       
   

and he walks with me
and he talks with me
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known

      
  
      
   


he speaks and the sound of his voice
is so sweet the birds hush their singing
and the melody that he gave to me
within my heart is ringing
    
  
     
    

and he walks with me
and he talks with me
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known

      
  
      
   

i’d stay in the garden with him
though the night around me be falling
but he bids me go through the
voice of woe
his voice to me is calling
    
   
       
   


and he walks with me
and he talks with me
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known

      
  
      
   


it came upon the midnight clear
that glorious song of old
from angels bending near the earth
to touch their harps of gold
  
    
   
   
   

“peace on the earth good will to men
from heaven’s all-gracious king”
the world in solemn stillness lay
to hear the angels sing
    
  
    
  

still thro’ the cloven skies they come
with peaceful wings unfurled
and still their heavenly music floats
o’er all the weary world
   
  
     
  

above its sad and lowly plains
they bend on hovering wing
and ever o’er its babel sounds
the blessed angels sing
     
   
   
  

and ye beneath life’s crushing load
whose forms are bending low
who toil along the climbing way
with painful steps and slow
    
 
   
  

look now for glad and golden hours
come swiftly on the wing
o rest beside the weary road
and hear the angels sing
   
  
    
  

for lo the days are hastening on
by prophet bards foretold
when with the ever-circling years
comes round the age of gold
   
 
    
  


when peace shall over all the earth
its ancient splendours fling
and the whole world give back the song
which now the angels sing
   
  
    
   


i need thee ev’ry hour
most gracious lord
no tender voice like thine
can peace afford
    
    
  
   
  

i need thee o i need thee
ev’ry hour i need thee
o bless me now my saviour
i come to thee

   
    
   
  

i need thee ev’ry hour
stay thou near by
temptations lose their power
when thou art nigh
    
 
  
 

i need thee o i need thee
ev’ry hour i need thee
o bless me now my saviour
i come to thee

   
    
   
  

i need thee ev’ry hour
in joy or pain
come quickly and abide
or life is vain
    
 
   
  

i need thee o i need thee
ev’ry hour i need thee
o bless me now my saviour
i come to thee

   
    
   
  

i need thee ev’ry hour
teach me thy will
and thy rich promises
in me fulfil
    
 
   
 

i need thee o i need thee
ev’ry hour i need thee
o bless me now my saviour
i come to thee

   
    
   
  

i need thee ev’ry hour
most holy one
oh make me thine indeed
thou blessed son
    
   
   
 


i need thee o i need thee
ev’ry hour i need thee
o bless me now my saviour
i come to thee

leave to thy god to order and provide
in ev’ry change he faithful will remain
be still my soul thy best thy heavenly friend
thro’ thorny ways leads to a joyful end

to guide the future as he has the past
thy hope thy confidence let nothing shake
all now mysterious shall be bright at last
be still my soul the waves and winds still know
his voice who ruled them while he dwelt below
   
    
      
       
     
    

be still my soul the hour is hast’ning on
when we shall be forever with the lord
when disappointment grief and fear are gone
sorrow forgot love’s purest joys restored
be still my soul when change and tears are past
all safe and blessed we shall meet at last

shall gladly be spent in promoting his praise
who opened his bosom to pour out this sea
of boundless salvation
for you and for me

o little town of bethlehem
how still we see thee lie
above thy deep and dreamless sleep
the silent stars go by
   
   
   
   
  

yet in thy dark streets shineth
the everlasting light
the hopes and fears of all the years
are met in thee tonight
  
  
   
   

for christ is born of mary
and gathered all above
while mortals sleep the angels keep
their watch of wondering love
    
    
      
 

o morning stars together
proclaim the holy birth
and praises sing to god the king
and peace to men on earth
    
   
     
   

how silently how silently
the wondrous gift is giv’n
so god imparts to human hearts
the blessings of his heaven
    
    
   
   

no ear may hear his coming
but in this world of sin
where meek souls will receive him still
the dear christ enters in
  
    
    
 

o holy child of bethlehem
descend to us we pray
cast out our sin and enter in
be born in us today

the great glad tidings tell
o come to us abide with us
our lord emmanuel
  
   
    
  



do you fear the foe
will in the conflict win
is it dark without you
darker still within

though troubles assail us
and dangers affright
though friends should all fail us
and foes all unite
  
  
  
  
   ―

yet one thing secures us
whatever betide
the promise assures us
“the lord will provide”
   
 
 
 

the birds without garner
or storehouse are fed
from them let us learn to
trust god for our bread
   
  
   
   

his saints what is fitting
shall ne’er be denied
so long as ’tis written
“the lord will provide”
 
 
  
 

when satan assails us
to stop up our path
and courage all fails us
we triumph by faith
 
  
  
  

he cannot take from us
though oft he has tried
this heart-cheering promise
“the lord will provide”
  
 
  
 

no strength of our own
and no goodness we claim
yet since we have known
of the saviour’s great name
  
    
  
  


in this our strong tower
for safety we hide
the lord is our power
“the lord will provide”
   
   
 
 



there is no other name
by which man can be saved
there is no other name under heaven
there is rest for my soul
and the wounded made whole
and the captives set free and forgiven

there is no other name


such love as i had never known
i’ve found in the grace that flowed
to me in my unrighteousness
this is why my heart and soul
and tongue confess

by which man can be saved
there is no other name under heaven
there is rest for my soul
and the wounded made whole
and the captives set free and forgiven

ev’ry tongue and tribe
gathered ’round your throne
with one voice we cry
“holy lord”

ev’ry tongue and tribe

i have placed all my hope
in a crucified man
in the wounds in his side
his feet and his hands

i have traded my pride
for a share in his shame
and the glory that one day
will burst from his pain
  i have placed all my hope

i’ve abandoned my trust
in the wise and the proud
for this fragile mysterious
weakness of god

and i dare to believe
in his scandalous claim
that his blood cleanses sin
for whoever will call on his name



live or die here i stand
i’ve placed my hope
in a crucified man

i believe as they beat
on his beautiful face
he turned a torturer’s chair
to an altar of grace

where the worst we can do
met the best that god does
where unspeakable hate
met the gaze of unstoppable love



at the crux of it all there he hangs
i’ve placed my hope in a crucified
man of sorrows man of grief
will he stay beyond belief

when the purest and best
took the force of our curse
death’s vict’ry armada
juddered into reverse

and either we bow
or we stumble and fall
for the wisdom of a suffering god
has made fools of us all



i gladly admit that i am
but i’ve placed my hope in a crucified
man of sorrows man of grief
will he stay beyond belief

i have buried my life
in the cold earth with him
like a seed in the winter
i wait for the spring

from that garden of tombs
eden rises again
and paradise blooms
from his body and never will end



he’ll finish all he began
creation hopes
in a crucified man


when i stand at the judgement
i have no other plan
i’ve placed my hope
in a crucified man

like the thief nailed beside him
i have no other plan
i’ve placed my hope
in a crucified man

i belong to the king
i’m a child of his love
i shall dwell in his palace so fair
for he tells of its bliss
in yon heaven above
and his children in splendour shall share
  

  
   
      
  
  
    

i belong to the king i’m a child of his love
and he never forsaketh his own
he will call me some day to his palace above
i shall dwell by his glorified throne

  
   
    
     
    
     
i belong to the king
and he loves me i know
for his mercy and kindness so free
are unceasingly mine
wheresoever i go
and my refuge unfailing is he

  
  
     
 
      
       

i belong to the king i’m a child of his love
and he never forsaketh his own
he will call me some day to his palace above
i shall dwell by his glorified throne

  
   
    
     
    
     
i belong to the king
and his promise is sure
that we all shall be gathered at last
in his kingdom above
by life’s waters so pure
when this life with its trials is past

  
  
      
  
   
    


i belong to the king i’m a child of his love
and he never forsaketh his own
he will call me some day to his palace above

what child is this who laid to rest
on mary’s lap is sleeping
whom angels greet with anthems sweet
while shepherds watch are keeping
     
     
 
    
  

this this is christ the king
whom shepherds guard and angels sing
haste haste to bring him laud
the babe the son of mary
   
     
   
  

why lies he in such mean estate
where ox and ass are feeding
good christian fear for sinners here
the silent word is pleading
     
   
     
  

nails spear shall pierce him thro’
the cross be borne for me for you
hail hail the word made flesh
the babe the son of mary
   
     
   
  

so bring him incense gold and myrrh
come peasant king to own him
the king of kings salvation brings
let loving hearts enthrone him
    
  
      
  


raise raise the song on high
the virgin sings her lullaby
joy joy for christ is born
the babe the son of mary
   
     
   
  


come thou almighty king
help us thy name to sing
help us to praise
      
    
  
 

father all glorious

o god our help in ages past
our hope for years to come
our shelter from the stormy blast
and our eternal home
    
      
   
    
   

under the shadow of thy throne
still may we dwell secure
sufficient is thine arm alone
and our defence is sure
    
 
  
   

before the hills in order stood
or earth received her frame
from everlasting thou art god
to endless years the same
  
   
    
      

a thousand ages in thy sight
are like an evening gone
short as the watch that ends the night
before the rising sun
    
  
     
  

time like an ever rolling stream
bears all its sons away
they fly forgotten as a dream
dies at the opening day

our hope for years to come
be thou my guide while life shall last
and our eternal home
    
   
     
   


i know not why god’s wond’rous grace
to me he hath made known
nor why unworthy christ in love
redeemed me for his own
-      
    
  
   
   

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

     
     
   
     

i know not how this saving faith
to me he did impart
nor how believing in his word
wrought peace within my heart
     
  
    
  

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

     
     
   
     

i know not how the spirit moves
convincing men of sin
revealing jesus through the word
creating faith in him
     
   
   
  

but “i know whom i have believed
and am persuaded that he is able
to keep that which i’ve committed
unto him against that day”

     
     
   
     

i know not when my lord may come
at night or noonday fair
nor if i’ll walk the vale with him
or meet him in the air
     
   ―

thou didst leave thy throne
and thy kingly crown
when thou camest to earth for me
but in bethlehem’s home
was there found no room
for thy holy nativity
  

      
   
      
   


o come to my heart lord jesus
there is room in my heart for thee

      
     

heaven’s arches rang when the angels sang
proclaiming thy royal decree
but of lowly birth didst thou come to earth
and in great humility
    
  
     
    


o come to my heart lord jesus
there is room in my heart for thee

      
     

thou camest o lord with the living word
that should set thy people free
but with mocking scorn and with crown of thorn
they bore thee to calvary
     
   
     
   


o come to my heart lord jesus
there is room in my heart for thee

      
     

when the heavens shall ring and the angels sing
at thy coming to victory
let thy voice call me home
saying “yet there is room
there is room at my side for thee”
    
     
     
     



and my heart shall rejoice lord jesus
when thou comest and callest me

      
     


god moves in a mysterious way
his wonders to perform
he plants his footsteps in the sea
and rides upon the storm
    
  
  
   
     

deep in unfathomable mines
of never-failing skill
he treasures up his bright designs
and works his sovereign will
  
   
     
   

ye fearful saints fresh courage take
the clouds ye so much dread
are big with mercy and shall break
in blessings on your head
   
 
   
  

judge not the lord by feeble sense
but trust him for his grace
behind a frowning providence
he hides a smiling face
  
  
  
  

his purposes will ripen fast
unfolding every hour
the bud may have a bitter taste
but sweet will be the flower
  
   
   
    


blind unbelief is sure to err
and scan his work in vain
god is his own interpreter
and he will make it plain
    
    
    
 


o lord you’re beautiful
your face is all i seek
for when your eyes are on this child
your grace abounds to me

o lord please light the fire
that once burned bright and clear
replace the lamp of my first love
that burns with holy fear
o lord you’re beautiful


i wanna take your word
and shine it all around
but first help me just to live it lord
and when i’m doing well
help me to never seek a crown
for my reward is giving glory to you



o lord you’re beautiful
your face is all i seek
for when your eyes are on this child
your grace abounds to me


the church’s one foundation
is jesus christ her lord
she is his new creation
by water and the word
   
   
    
  
 

from heav’n he came and sought her
to be his holy bride
with his own blood he bought her
and for her life he died
    
   
  
   

she is from ev’ry nation
yet one o’er all the earth
her charter of salvation
one lord one faith one birth
 
  
  
 

one holy name she blesses
partakes one holy food
and to one hope she presses
with ev’ry grace endued
  
  
  
  

though with a scornful wonder
men see her sore oppressed
by schisms rent asunder
by heresies distressed
 
 
  
 

yet saints their watch are keeping
their cry goes up “how long”
and soon the night of weeping
shall be the morn of song
   
   
  
  

’mid toil and tribulation
and tumult of her war
she waits the consummation
of peace forevermore
   
   
  
  

till with the vision glorious
her longing eyes are blest
and the great church victorious
shall be the church at rest
  
  
  
 

yet she on earth hath union
with god the three in one
and mystic sweet communion
with those whose rest is won
    
    
  
 


with all her sons and daughters
who by the master’s hand
led through the deathly waters
repose in eden land

years i spent in vanity and pride
caring not my lord was crucified
knowing not it was for me he died
on calvary
    
    
      
    
  

mercy there was great and grace was free
pardon there was multiplied to me
there my burdened soul found liberty
at calvary

   
    
   
  

by god’s word at last my sin i learned
then i trembled at the law i’d spurned
till my guilty soul imploring turned
to calvary
    
    
    
  

mercy there was great and grace was free
pardon there was multiplied to me
there my burdened soul found liberty
at calvary

   
    
   
  

now i’ve giv’n to jesus ev’rything
now i gladly own him as my king
now my raptured soul can only sing
of calvary
   
      
   
  

mercy there was great and grace was free
pardon there was multiplied to me
there my burdened soul found liberty
at calvary

   
    
   
  

o the love that drew salvation’s plan
o the grace that brought it down to man
o the mighty gulf that god did span
at calvary
    
   
   
  


mercy there was great and grace was free
pardon there was multiplied to me
there my burdened soul found liberty
at calvary

   
    
   
  


as sure as jesus lives
to me his strength he gives
then fear anxiety will go
my heart with faith o’erflow
  
  
  
   
  

he is the shepherd true
his sheep he leadeth too
to pleasant pastures guideth me
to waters fresh and sweet
   
   
     
   

and when the sunlight fades
the darkness me o’ershades
i know that jesus through the night
will guard me with his might
   
   
    
   

yes if my faith should fail
the enemy prevail
then to the saviour’s heart i’ll flee
to find a remedy
   
 
    
   


now unto him i look
my burden to him take
oh jesus loves me tenderly
this will my comfort be

the son of god goes forth to war
a kingly crown to gain
his blood-red banner streams afar
who follows in his train
    
    
  
    
   

who best can drink his cup of woe
triumphant over pain
who patient bears his cross below
he follows in his train
    
 
   
   

that martyr first whose eagle eye
could pierce beyond the grave
who saw his master in the sky
and called on him to save
    
  
   
   

like him with pardon on his tongue
in midst of mortal pain
he prayed for them that did the wrong
who follows in his train
  
  
    
   
a glorious band the chosen few
on whom the spirit came
twelve valiant saints their hope they
knew
and mocked the cross and flame

through peril toil and pain
o god to us may grace be given
to follow in their train
   
  
    
   


my lord has garments so wondrous fine
and myrrh their texture fills
its fragrance reached to this heart of mine
with joy my being thrills
 
   
  
    
    

out of the ivory palaces
into a world of woe
only his great eternal love
made my saviour go

for aloes had a part
and when i think of the cross he bore
my eyes with tear-drops start
   
   
    
   

out of the ivory palaces
into a world of woe
only his great eternal love
made my saviour go

with healing in a touch
each time my feet in some sin
have slipped
he took me from its clutch
   
 
    
   

out of the ivory palaces
into a world of woe
only his great eternal love
made my saviour go

   
    
    
  

in garments glorious he will come
to open wide the door
and i shall enter my heav’nly home
to dwell forevermore
    
   
     
    


out of the ivory palaces
into a world of woe
only his great eternal love
made my saviour go

i’ll see the lights of glory
and i’ll know he reigns

because he lives all fear is gone
because i know he holds my future
and life is worth the living

jesus is standing in pilate’s hall
friendless forsaken betrayed by all
hearken what meaneth the sudden call
what will you do with jesus
   
   
   
   
   

what will you do with jesus
neutral you cannot be
some day your heart will be asking
“what will he do with me”

   
  
   
    

jesus is standing on trial still
you can be false to him if you will
you can be faithful through good or ill
what will you do with jesus
    
     
   
   

what will you do with jesus
neutral you cannot be
some day your heart will be asking
“what will he do with me”

   
  
   
    

will you evade him as pilate tried
or will you choose him whate’er betide
vainly you struggle from him to hide
what will you do with jesus
     
    
    
   

what will you do with jesus
neutral you cannot be
some day your heart will be asking
“what will he do with me”

   
  
   
    

will you like peter your lord deny
or will you scorn from his foes to fly
daring for jesus to live or die
what will you do with jesus
     
    
     
   

what will you do with jesus
neutral you cannot be
some day your heart will be asking
“what will he do with me”

   
  
   
    

“jesus i give thee my heart today
jesus i’ll follow thee all the way
gladly obeying thee” will you say
“this i will do with jesus”
    
      
      
   


what will you do with jesus
neutral you cannot be
some day your heart will be asking
“what will he do with me”

entered our world your glory veiled
not to be served but to serve
and give your life that we might live


this is our god the servant king
he calls us now to follow him
to bring our lives as a daily offering
of worship to the servant king

there in the garden of tears
my heavy load he chose to bear
his heart with sorrow was torn
“yet not my will but yours” he said


this is our god the servant king
he calls us now to follow him
to bring our lives as a daily offering
of worship to the servant king

hands that flung stars into space
to cruel nails surrendered

he calls us now to follow him
to bring our lives as a daily offering
of worship to the servant king

so let us learn how to serve
and in our lives enthrone him

the first nol the angel did say
was to certain poor shepherds
in fields as they lay
in fields where they lay keeping their sheep
on a cold winter’s night that was so deep
   
   
   
   
    


nol nol nol nol
born is the king of israel

   
     

they lookd up and saw a star
shining in the east beyond them far
and to the earth it gave great light
and so it continued both day and night
   
   
    
    


nol nol nol nol
born is the king of israel

   
     

and by the light of that same star
three wise men came from country far
to seek for a king was their intent
and to follow the star wherever it went
   
  
  
     


nol nol nol nol
born is the king of israel

   
     

then did they know assuredly
within that house the king did lie
one entered it them for to see
and found the babe in poverty
     
    
     
  


nol nol nol nol
born is the king of israel

   
     

then entered in those wise men three
full reverently upon the knee
and offered there in his presence
their gold and myrrh and frankincense
    
   
  
     



nol nol nol nol
born is the king of israel

o word of words the sweetest
oh words in which there lie
all promise all fulfilment
and end of mystery
  
  
   
   
  

lamenting or rejoicing
with doubt or terror nigh
i hear the “come” of jesus
and to his cross i fly
  
   
   
   

come oh come to me
come oh come to me
weary heavy-laden
come oh come to me  

   
   
 
     

o soul why shouldst thou wander
from such a loving friend
cling closer closer to him
stay with him to the end
 
  
   
  

alas i am so helpless
so very full of sin
for i am ever wand’ring
and coming back again
  
 
  
    

come oh come to me
come oh come to me
weary heavy-laden
come oh come to me  

   
   
 
     

o each time draw me nearer
that soon the “come” may be
naught but a gentle whisper
to one close close to thee
    
   
     
  

then over sea and mountain
far from or near my home
i’ll take thy hand and follow
at that sweet whisper “come”
    
    
   
  


come oh come to me
come oh come to me
weary heavy-laden
come oh come to me  

   
   
 
     



you shine
brighter than the brightest star
your love
purer than the purest heart

you shine
filling us with courage and strength
to follow you
  you shine
why should i fear man
when you made the heavens
why should i be afraid
when you put the stars in place
why should i lose heart
when i know how great you are
why should i give up
when your plans are full of love

in this world we will have trouble
but you have overcome the world



you shine
brighter than the brightest star
your love
purer than the purest heart

you shine
filling us with courage and strength
to follow you


you are the stone
that the builders rejected
a rock of refuge
where my pride is broken

a sure foundation
when the sand is sinking
where we are built upon
like living stones
  you are the stone



there is no one else like you
there is no one like you lord
there is no one else like you
son of man and son of god
son of man and son of god

when from the cross
you to the depths descended
the host of hell conspired
to make you captive

but ev’ry chain of sin
and death you’ve broken
are triumphed over
by your mighty power



there is no one else like you
there is no one like you lord
there is no one else like you
son of man and son of god
son of man and son of god

i want to run
the race you’ve set before me
even to share
in the suff’ring of the cross
that i might gain
the prize for which you called me
to be with you son of man
and son of god
to be with you son of man
and son of god

then from the earth
you to the heights ascended
where you are seated
at your father’s right hand

forever pleading
for the souls you’ve captured
forever watching
as you call us home



there is no one else like you
there is no one like you lord
there is no one else like you
son of man and son of god
son of man and son of god
son of man and son of god


brightly beams our father’s mercy
from his lighthouse evermore
but to us he gives the keeping
of the lights along the shore
    
    
  
    
  

let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
for to us he gives the keeping
of the lights along the shore

     
   
  
   

dark the night of sin has settled
loud the angry billows roar
eager eyes are watching longing
for the lights along the shore
    
   
  
    

let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
eager eyes are watching longing
for the lights along the shore

     
   
  
   

trim your feeble lamp my brother
some poor sailor tempest tossed
trying now to make the harbour
in the darkness may be lost
   
   
   
  


let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
trying now to make the harbour
some poor sailor may be lost

     
   
  
   


i’ve wandered far away from god
now i’m coming home

dear lord and father of mankind
forgive our foolish ways
reclothe us in our rightful mind
in purer lives thy service find
in deeper reverence praise
   
   
   
    
   
  

in simple trust like theirs who heard
beside the syrian sea
the gracious calling of the lord
let us like them without a word
rise up and follow thee
     
  
    
    
   

drop thy still dews of quietness
till all our strivings cease
take from our souls the strain and stress
and let our ordered lives confess
the beauty of thy peace
  
   
   
    
   

breathe through the heats of our desire
thy coolness and thy balm
let sense be dumb let flesh retire
speak through the earthquake wind
and fire
o still small voice of calm
  
 
   
    
   


you are most worthy o lord our god
you are most worthy o lord our god
you are most worthy o lord our god
worthy are you

worthy are you

thy holy spirit lord alone
can turn our hearts from sin
his power alone can sanctify
and keep us pure within
   
    
  
     
   

thy holy spirit lord alone
can deeper love inspire
his power alone within our souls
can light the sacred fire
     
 
    
   

thy holy spirit lord can bring
the gifts we seek in prayer
his voice can words of comfort speak
and still each wave of care
    
   
   
  


thy holy spirit lord can give
the grace we need this hour
and while we wait o spirit come
in sanctifying power
    
 
     
  


in a mock purple arrayed
with thorns piercing thy brow
with hands bound taken out of the city
   
   
  e
   

thy face showing the suff’ring
which thou didst allow
also for your tormentorswhat pity

  
  
     


but thy suff’ring transcends
the mere physical lord
although thou art in dire situation
    
 
   

greater far is the
spiritual suff’ring endured
knowing they would reject thy salvation

    
 
     


thy compassion o lord
reaches out to thy foes
thy heart for them is o’erfilling
  
 
    

they do not understand
to thee their hearts are closed
but thy prophecy they are fulfilling

   
 
     


“bring the sceptre to him
on your knees everyone
live forever o king”moods
are wors’ning
  
   
   


and now into thy hand
o thou god’s only son
they the reed of bulrushes are forcing

   
  
  


with the reeds they beat down
on the sharp thorny crown
and slaps on thy gaunt cheeks
follow after
  
  
    

and the blood from thy forehead
is now trickling down
all the more they are engulfed with
laughter
   
   
    

   
 
    

    
  
     



yield not to temptation
for yielding is sin
each vict’ry will help you
some other to win
   
   
   
 
 

fight manfully onward
dark passions subdue
look ever to jesus
he will carry you through
  
   
   
  

ask the saviour to help you
comfort strengthen and keep you
he is willing to aid you
he will carry you through

   
   
   
  

shun evil companions
bad language disdain
god’s name hold in rev’rence
nor take it in vain
   
   
  
 

be thoughtful and earnest
kind-hearted and true
look ever to jesus
he will carry you through
  
   
   
  

ask the saviour to help you
comfort strengthen and keep you

he will carry you through

   
   
   
  

to him to o’ercometh
god giveth a crown
thro’ faith we shall conquer
though often cast down
  
 
  
  

he who is our saviour
our strength will renew
look ever to jesus
he will carry you through

brightest and best of the sons of the morning
dawn on our darkness and lend us thine aid
star of the east the horizon adorning
guide where our infant redeemer is laid
  
     
    
     
    

cold on his cradle the dewdrops are shining
low lies his head with the beasts of the stall
angels adore him in slumber reclining
maker and monarch and saviour of all
    
    
     
    

say shall we yield him in costly devotion
odours of edom and offerings divine
gems of the mountain and pearls of the ocean
myrrh from the forest or gold from the mine
      
   
   
      

vainly we offer each ample oblation
vainly with gifts would his favour secure
richer by far is the heart’s adoration
dearer to god are the prayers of the poor
    
    
    
    


brightest and best of the sons of the morning

there is a gate that stands ajar
and through its portals gleaming
a radiance from the cross afar
the saviour’s love revealing
   
    
   
  
    

o depth of mercy can it be
that gate was left ajar for me
for me for me for me for me
was left ajar for me

   
   
   
  

that gate ajar stands free for all
who seek through it salvation
the rich and poor the great and small
of every tribe and nation
    
    
   
  

o depth of mercy can it be
that gate was left ajar for me
for me for me for me for me
was left ajar for me

   
   
   
  
press onward then though foes may
frown
while mercy’s gate is open
accept the cross and win the crown
love’s everlasting token
     
  
    
  

o depth of mercy can it be
that gate was left ajar for me
for me for me for me for me
was left ajar for me

   
   
   
  

beyond the river’s brink we’ll lay
the cross that here is given
and bear the crown of life away
and love him more in heaven
    
    
  
  


o depth of mercy can it be
that gate was left ajar for me
for me for me for me for me
was left ajar for me

and i i’m lost without you
  this is the air i breathe


i’m a pilgrim and i’m a stranger
i can tarry i can tarry but a night
do not detain me for i am going
to where the fountains are ever flowing
    
     
        
     
     


i’m a pilgrim and i’m a stranger
i can tarry i can tarry but a night

     
        

there’s the city to which i journey
my redeemer my redeemer is its light
there is no sorrow nor any sighing
nor any tears there nor any dying
     
    
  
    
    


i’m a pilgrim and i’m a stranger
i can tarry i can tarry but a night

     
        
there the glory is ever shining
oh my longing heart my longing heart
is there
here in this country so dark and dreary
i long have wandered forlorn and weary
     
      

      
    



i’m a pilgrim and i’m a stranger
i can tarry i can tarry but a night

when with rapture i behold him
jesus christ who died for me
     
      
   
    
   

face to face i shall behold him
far beyond the starry sky
face to face in all his glory
i shall see him by and by

with the darkling veil between
but a blessed day is coming
when his glory shall be seen

when are banished grief and pain
when the crooked ways are straightened
and the dark things shall be plain
   
   
   
   

face to face i shall behold him
far beyond the starry sky
face to face in all his glory
i shall see him by and by

    
   
     
  

face to face o blissful moment
face to face to see and know
face to face with my redeemer
jesus christ who loves me so
     
    
    
    


face to face i shall behold him
far beyond the starry sky
face to face in all his glory
i shall see him by and by

    
   
     
  


away in a manger
no crib for a bed
the little lord jesus
laid down his sweet head
the stars in the bright sky
looked down where he lay
the little lord jesus
asleep on the hay
  away in a manger

the cattle are lowing
the baby awakes
but little lord jesus
no crying he makes
i love thee lord jesus
look down from the sky
and stay by my side
until morning is nigh


be near me lord jesus
i ask thee to stay
close by me for ever
and love me i pray
bless all the dear children
in thy tender care
and fit us for heaven
to live with thee there

hope of earth and joy of heaven

hope of earth and joy of heaven

jesus i am resting resting
in the joy of what thou art
i am finding out the greatness
of thy loving heart

thou hast bid me gaze upon thee
and thy beauty fills my soul
for by thy transforming power
thou hast made me whole
jesus i am resting resting

o how great thy loving-kindness
vaster broader than the sea
o how marvellous thy goodness
lavished all on me

yes i rest in thee beloved
know what wealth of grace is thine
know thy certainty of promise
and have made it mine

simply trusting thee lord jesus
i behold thee as thou art
and thy love so pure so changeless
satisfies my heart

satisfies its deepest longings
meets supplies its every need
compasseth me round with blessings
thine is love indeed


ever lift thy face upon me
as i work and wait for thee
resting ’neath thy smile lord jesus
earth’s dark shadows flee

brightness of my father’s glory
sunshine of my father’s face
keep me ever trusting resting
fill me with thy grace


jesus i my cross have taken
all to leave and follow thee
destitute despised forsaken
thou from hence my all shalt be
     
     
   
   
    

perish every fond ambition
all i’ve sought and hoped and known
yet how rich is my condition
god and heav’n are still my own
   
   
   
     

let the world despise and leave me
they have left my saviour too
human hearts and looks deceive me
thou art not like man untrue
    
    
   
    

and while thou shalt smile upon me
god of wisdom love and might
foes may hate and friends may shun me
show thy face and all is bright
   
     
   
    

man may trouble and distress me
’twill but drive me to thy breast
life with trials hard may press me
heaven will bring me sweeter rest
   
    
  
  

oh ’tis not in grief to harm me
while thy love is left to me
oh ’twere not in joy to charm me
were that joy unmixed with thee
   
    
   
    

hasten on from grace to glory
armed by faith and winged by prayer
heav’n’s eternal days before me
god’s own hand shall guide me there
  
  
  
   


soon shall close my earthly mission
swift shall pass my pilgrim days
hope shall change to glad fruition
faith to sight and prayer to praise

’neath the stars of the night
walked the saviour of light
in the garden of dew-ladened breeze
 
 
   
     

where no light could be found
jesus knelt on the ground
there he prayed ’neath the old
olive trees
   
  
    

’neath the old olive trees
’neath the old olive trees
went the saviour alone on his knees

  
  
   

“not my will thine be done”
cried the father’s own son
as he knelt ’neath the old olive trees
  
  
    

all the sins of the world
on the saviour was hurled
as he knelt in the garden alone
  
   
    

hear his soul-burdened plea
“let this cup pass from me
even so not my will thine be done”
  
  
     

’neath the old olive trees
’neath the old olive trees
went the saviour alone on his knees

  
  
   

“not my will thine be done”
cried the father’s own son
as he knelt ’neath the old olive trees
  
  
    

may my song ever be
of the love proffered me
by my lord all alone on his knees
   
   
    

praise his wonderful name
he who bore all my blame
as he knelt ’neath the old olive trees
    
    
    

’neath the old olive trees
’neath the old olive trees
went the saviour alone on his knees

  
  
   


“not my will thine be done”
cried the father’s own son
as he knelt ’neath the old olive trees

i spent all my days in contention and strife

in sin i was dead
but now i am saved
“he loves you he loves you”

in sin i was dead
but now i am saved
“he loves you he loves you”

ever near the christian’s side
gently lead us by the hand
pilgrims in a desert land
  
    
     
   
   

weary souls fore’er rejoice
while they hear that sweetest voice
whispering softly “wanderer come
follow me i’ll guide thee home”
   
    
   
  

ever present truest friend
ever near thine aid to lend
leave us not to doubt and fear
groping on in darkness drear
   
   
    
     

when the storms are raging sore
hearts grow faint and hopes give o’er
whispering softly “wanderer come
follow me i’ll guide thee home”
  
   
   
  

when our days of toil cease
waiting still for sweet release
nothing left but heaven and prayer
wondering if our names are there
   
   
    
   


wading deep the dismal flood
pleading naught but jesus’ blood
whispering softly “wanderer come
follow me i’ll guide thee home”

precious promise for you and for me
“through the flood and the fire i will
take you
evermore by your side i will be”

when in weakness you stand ’fore the foe
i’ll be strong to defend i’ll not fail you
from defeat unto vict’ry you’ll go”
   
    
    
   
“i’ll be watching in tenderness o’er you
as a mother does over her child
i will walk your life’s pathway before you
shielding you when life’s tempests are
wild”
     
     
     
     
“should your mother and father forsake
you
i will ever be right at your side
to my haven of rest i will take you
in my presence you’ll ever abide”
  
  
  
  
“i will comfort the heart that is lonely
i will scatter the darkness of night
and the heart that has known trouble
only
will in me find the source of delight”
   
    
    
    

“never will i forget nor forsake you”
precious promise for you and for me
“through the flood and the fire i will
take you
evermore by your side i will be”

how deep the father’s love for us
how vast beyond all measure
that he should give his only son
to make a wretch his treasure

how great the pain of searing loss
the father turns his face away
as wounds which mar the chosen one
bring many sons to glory
how deep the father’s love

behold the man upon a cross
my sin upon his shoulders
ashamed i hear my mocking voice
call out among the scoffers

it was my sin that held him there
until it was accomplished
his dying breath has brought me life
i know that it is finished


i will not boast in anything
no gifts no pow’r no wisdom
but i will boast in jesus christ
his death and resurrection

why should i gain from his reward
i cannot give an answer
but this i know with all my heart
his wounds have paid my ransom

god will take care of you
beneath his wings of love abide
god will take care of you

“thy strength indeed is small
child of weakness watch and pray

thy power and thine alone
can change the leper’s spots
and melt the heart of stone

whereby thy grace to claim
i’ll wash my garments white
in the blood of calvary’s lamb

i’ve seen the lightning flashing
i’ve heard the thunder roll
i’ve felt sin’s breakers dashing
which almost conquered my soul
  
  
  
   
    

i’ve heard the voice of my saviour
bidding me still to fight on
he promised never to leave me
never to leave me alone
   
  
   
    

no never alone
no never alone
he promised never to leave me
he’ll claim me for his own

   
   
   
   

no never alone
no never alone
he promised never to leave me
never to leave me alone
   
   
   
   

the world’s fierce winds are blowing
temptation sharp and keen
i have a peace in knowing
my saviour stands between
   
  
  
   

he stands to shield me from danger
when my friends are all gone
he promised never to leave me
never to leave me alone

when in affliction’s valley
i tread the road of care
my saviour helps me carry
the cross so heavy to bear
    
   
    
  

though all around me is darkness
earthly joys all flown
my saviour whispers his promise
never to leave me alone
   
   
   
    

no never alone
no never alone
he promised never to leave me
he’ll claim me for his own

   
   
   
   

no never alone

he promised never to leave me
never to leave me alone
   
   
   
   

he died on calvary’s mountain
for me they piercd his side
for me he opened that fountain
the crimson cleansing tide
   
   
  
   

for me he waiteth in glory
seated upon his throne
he promised never to leave me
never to leave me alone
   
  
    
    

no never alone
no never alone
he promised never to leave me
he’ll claim me for his own

   
   
   
   


no never alone
no never alone
he promised never to leave me
never to leave me alone

what can make us white as snow

what can fill the emptiness
what can mend our brokenness

mighty awesome wonderful
is the holy cross
where the lamb laid down his life
to lift us from the fall
mighty is the power of the cross

what restores our faith in god
what reveals the father’s love
what can lead the wayward home
what can melt a heart of stone

what can free the guilty ones
what can save and overcome
overcome



mighty awesome wonderful
is the holy cross
where the lamb laid down his life
to lift us from the fall
mighty is the power of the cross


it’s a miracle to me

hearts rejoicing as we
congregate in the name of our lord
   
 
  
   

jesus promised that he
present with us would be
let our hearts beat with his in accord
  
   
    

oh how pleasant it is
in his presence to meet
shutting out the world’s tumult and din
   
   
   

how rewarding it is
just to sit at his feet
and receive untold blessings from him
  
 
  

travel-weary we come
to this haven of rest
to relax where god’s waters still flow
  
 
   

then renewed and restored
by his spirit refreshed
on our way with rejoicing we’ll go
  
  
   

in a fellowship blessed
our hearts have been bound
and by manna from heaven been fed
   
  
   

in god’s wonderful book
daily bread we have found
and new strength for the pathway ahead
  
  
    

in a close-knit communion
with christ as our head
and endued with god’s power from high
 
 
    


on the pathway of life
we by him will be led
knowing god all our needs will supply
  
  
   


there is life for a look
at the crucified one
there is life at this moment for thee
   
   
   
    

then look sinner look
unto him and be saved
unto him who was nailed to the tree
   
   
     

look look look and live
there is life for a look
at the crucified one
there is life at this moment for thee

   
   
  
      

oh why was he there
as the bearer of sin
if on jesus thy guilt was not laid
  
   
   

oh why from his side
flowed the sin-cleansing blood
if his dying thy debt has not paid
  
   
    

look look look and live
there is life for a look
at the crucified one
there is life at this moment for thee

   
   
  
      

it is not thy tears
of repentance or prayers
but the blood that atones for the soul
 
  
   

on him then who shed it
thou mayest at once
thy weight of iniquities roll
   
  
     

look look look and live
there is life for a look
at the crucified one
there is life at this moment for thee

   
   
  
      

then doubt not thy welcome
since god has declared
there remaineth no more to be done
  
  
     

that once in the end
of the world he appeared
and completed the work he begun
   
     
     

look look look and live
there is life for a look
at the crucified one
there is life at this moment for thee

   
   
  
      

then take with rejoicing
from jesus at once
the life everlasting he gives
    
 
   

and know with assurance
thou never canst die
since jesus thy righteousness lives
   
   
    

look look look and live
there is life for a look
at the crucified one
there is life at this moment for thee

   
   
  
      



precious soul cease from sadness and sorrow
just remember your god loves you still
there awaits you a brighter tomorrow
what god promises he will fulfil
    
    
    
    
     

place your trust in the lord doubts will vanish
and commune with him often in prayer
from your heart every fear he will banish
and your soul he will lift from despair
    
    
    
    

bear in mind jesus christ died to save you
on the cross for your sins he did pay
everlasting salvation he gave you
and he said “i am with you always”
     
    
     
     

don’t despair when your burdens appal you
don’t complain at the load you must bear
and at times when hard trials befall you
rest assured you are under his care
    
     
    
    

over life’s winds and waves he’s the master
to protect us he ever is near
he will save from the brink of disaster
and our craft into port he will steer
     
    
      
    
    
    
      
      
    
    
    
     

we hard trials are still undergoing
but soon life’s final battle will come
we will finish our course fully knowing
that we’re off to our heavenly home

there we’ll have peace and quietfor never
a disturbance or storm will be there
christ our saviour will reign there forever
and his glory and splendour we’ll share
   
     
    
    


precious soul cease from sadness and sorrow
the transition for us may be nigh
and we know nottoday or tomorrow
we may be in our “homeland” on high

o sacred head now wounded
with grief and shame weighed down
now scornfully surrounded
with thorns thine only crown
  
  
   
 
   

how pale thou art with anguish
with sore abuse and scorn
how does that visage languish
which once was bright as morn
    
  
    
   

what thou my lord hast suffered
was all for sinners’ gain
mine mine was the transgression
but thine the deadly pain
   
  
  
 

lo here i fall my saviour
’tis i deserve thy place
look on me with thy favour
vouchsafe to me thy grace
   
 
  
  

my burden in thy passion
lord thou hast borne for me
for it was my transgression
which brought this woe on thee
   
    
  
  

i cast me down before thee
wrath were my rightful lot
have mercy i implore thee
redeemer spurn me not
  
   
  
   

what language shall i borrow
to thank thee dearest friend
for this thy dying sorrow
thy pity without end

outlive my love to thee

with words of truth and love
thy spirit oft hath led me
to heavenly joys above
     
  
  
 


now thank we all our god
with heart and hands and voices
who wondrous things hath done
in whom this world rejoices
    
  
   
  
     

who from our mothers’ arms
hath blessed us on our way
with countless gifts of love
and still is ours today

through all our life be near us
with ever joyful hearts
and blessed peace to cheer us

the cross

if the way of the cross i miss
   
     
  
   
     
    

the way of the cross leads home
the way of the cross leads home
it is sweet to know as i onward go
the way of the cross leads home

   
   
     
   
i must needs go on in the blood-
sprinkled way
the path that the saviour trod
if i ever climb to the heights sublime
where the soul is at home with god
     
   
    

   

the way of the cross leads home
the way of the cross leads home
it is sweet to know as i onward go
the way of the cross leads home

   
   
     
   
then i bid farewell to the way of the world
to walk in it never more
for my lord says “come” and i seek
my home
where he waits at the open door
    
 
   
     
     


the way of the cross leads home
the way of the cross leads home
it is sweet to know as i onward go

beyond the sunset o blissful morning
when with our saviour heav’n is begun
earth’s toiling ended o glorious dawning
beyond the sunset when day is done
 
    
   
   
   

beyond the sunset no clouds will gather
no storms will threaten no fears annoy
o day of gladness o day unending
beyond the sunset eternal joy
    
   
   
    
beyond the sunset a hand will guide me
to god the father whom i adore
his glorious presence his words of
welcome
will be my portion on that fair shore
   
      
      
    

beyond the sunset o glad reunion
with our dear loved ones who’ve
gone before
in that fair homeland we’ll know no
parting
beyond the sunset forevermore

i’m pressing on the upward way
new heights i’m gaining every day
still praying as i’m onward bound
“lord plant my feet on higher ground”
 
   
    
    
    

lord lift me up and let me stand
by faith on heaven’s tableland
a higher plain than i have found
lord plant my feet on higher ground

   
     
    
   
my heart has no desire to stay
where doubts arise and fears dismay
though some may dwell where these
abound
my prayer my aim is higher ground
    
    
     
    

lord lift me up and let me stand
by faith on heaven’s tableland
a higher plain than i have found
lord plant my feet on higher ground

   
     
    
   

i want to live above the world
though satan’s darts at me are hurled
for faith has caught the joyful sound
the song of saints on higher ground
    
   
    
    

lord lift me up and let me stand
by faith on heaven’s tableland
a higher plain than i have found
lord plant my feet on higher ground

   
     
    
   

i want to scale the utmost height
and catch a gleam of glory bright
but still i’ll pray ’til heaven i’ve found
“lord lead me on to higher ground”
   
  
   
   


lord lift me up and let me stand
by faith on heaven’s tableland
a higher plain than i have found
lord plant my feet on higher ground

   
     
    
   

take my life and let it be
consecrated lord to thee
take my hands and let them move
at the impulse of thy love
at the impulse of thy love
    
   
  
    
   
   
take my feet and let them be
swift and beautiful for thee
take my voice and let me sing
always only for my king
always only for my king
   
   
    
     
     
take my lips and let them be
filled with messages for thee
take my silver and my gold
not a mite would i withhold
not a mite would i withhold
   
  
  
   
   

take my love my god i pour
at thy feet its treasure store
take myself and i will be
ever only all for thee
ever only all for thee
   
     
   
   
   


blessd be the fountain of blood
to a world of sinners revealed
blessd be the dear son of god
only by his stripes we are healed
   
    
   
   
   

tho’ i’ve wandered far from his fold
bringing to my heart pain and woe
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow
    
    
  
    

whiter than the snow
whiter than the snow
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow

   
  
    

thorny was the crown that he wore
and the cross his body o’ercame
grievous were the sorrows he bore
but he suffered thus not in vain
   
     
   
    

may i to that fountain be led
made to cleanse my sins here below
wash me in the blood that he shed
and i shall be whiter than snow
    
    
  
    

whiter than the snow
whiter than the snow
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow

   
  
    

father i have wandered from thee
often has my heart gone astray
crimson do my sins seem to me
water cannot wash them away
   
    
    
     

jesus to the fountain of thine
leaning on thy promise i go
cleanse me by thy washing divine
and i shall be whiter than snow
     
    
  
    


whiter than the snow
whiter than the snow
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow

o church arise and put your armour on
hear the call of christ our captain
for now the weak can say that they
are strong
in the strength that god has given

with shield of faith and belt of truth
we’ll stand against the devil’s lies
an army bold whose battle-cry is love
reaching out to those in darkness
  o church arise
our call to war to love the captive soul
but to rage against the captor
and with the sword that makes
the wounded whole
we will fight with faith and valour

when faced with trials on ev’ry side
we know the outcome is secure
and christ will have the prize
for which he died
an inheritance of nations
come see the cross where love and
mercy meet
as the son of god is stricken
then see his foes lie crushed beneath
his feet
for the conqueror has risen

and as the stone is rolled away
and christ emerges from the grave
this vict’ry march continues till the day
ev’ry eye and heart shall see him

so spirit come put strength in
ev’ry stride
give grace for ev’ry hurdle
that we may run with faith to win the prize
of a servant good and faithful

as saints of old still line the way
retelling triumphs of his grace
we hear their calls and hunger for the day
when with christ we stand in glory

and my brokenness
is mended
by you
my lord and friend

is found in you

and i am caught
in this passion of knowing
this endless love
i have in you

a child of god

your will that i am free

your will that i am free

but wholly lean on jesus’ name
   
   
   
   
   

on christ the solid rock i stand
all other ground is sinking sand
all other ground is sinking sand

i rest on his unchanging grace
in every high and stormy gale
my anchor holds within the veil

dressed in his righteousness alone
faultless to stand before the throne
     
    
   
     


on christ the solid rock i stand
all other ground is sinking sand
all other ground is sinking sand

once in royal david’s city
stood a lowly cattle shed
where a mother laid her baby
in a manger for his bed
mary was that mother mild
jesus christ her little child
once in royal david’s city


he came down to earth from heaven
who is god and lord of all
and his shelter was a stable
and his cradle was a stall
with the poor and meek and lowly
lived on earth our saviour holy


and through all his wondrous childhood
day by day like us he grew
he was little weak and helpless
tears and smiles like us he knew
and he feeleth for our sadness
and he shareth in our gladness


still among the poor and lowly
hope in christ is brought to birth
with the promise of salvation
for the nations of the earth
still in him our life is found
and our hope of heav’n is crowned


and our eyes at last shall see him
through his own redeeming love
for that child so dear and gentle
is our lord in heav’n above
and he leads his children on
to the place where he is gone



not in that poor lowly stable
with the oxen standing by
we shall see him but in heaven
set at god’s right hand on high
when like stars his children crowned
all in white shall wait around


true-hearted whole-hearted faithful and loyal
king of our lives by thy grace we will be
under the standard exalted and royal
strong in thy strength we will battle for thee
 
   
    
    
   

peal out the watchword silence it never
song of our spirits rejoicing and free
peal out the watchword loyal forever
king of our lives by thy grace we will be

   
    
     
     

true-hearted whole-hearted fullest allegiance
yielding henceforth to our glorious king
valiant endeavour and loving obedience
freely and joyously now would we bring
   
    
    
     

peal out the watchword silence it never
song of our spirits rejoicing and free
peal out the watchword loyal forever
king of our lives by thy grace we will be

   
    
     
     

true-hearted whole-hearted saviour
all-glorious
take thy great power and reign there alone
over our wills and affections victorious
freely surrendered and wholly thine own
   
    
    
    


peal out the watchword silence it never
song of our spirits rejoicing and free
peal out the watchword loyal forever
king of our lives by thy grace we will be

   
    
     
     


my faith looks up to thee
thou lamb of calvary
saviour divine
   
   
  
 

now hear me while i pray
take all my guilt away
oh let me from this day
be wholly thine
  
 
   
  

may thy rich grace impart
strength to my fainting heart
my zeal inspire
  
    
   

as thou hast died for me
oh may my love to thee
pure warm and changeless be
a living fire
    
   
   
 

while life’s dark maze i tread
and griefs around me spread
be thou my guide
   
   
 

bid darkness turn to day
wipe sorrow’s tears away
nor let me ever stray
from thee aside
   
 
   
  

when ends life’s transient dream
when death’s cold sullen stream
shall o’er me roll
   
  
 


blest saviour then in love
fear and distrust remove
oh bear me safe above
a ransomed soul
  
    
    
  


jesus lover of my soul
all consuming fire is in your gaze
jesus i want you to know
i will follow you all my days

for no one else in history is like you
and history itself belongs to you
alpha and omega you have loved me
and i will share eternity with you
jesus lover of my soul



it’s all about you jesus
and all this is for you
for your glory and your fame
it’s not about me
as if you should do things my way
you alone are god
and i surrender to your ways


for the beauty of the earth
for the glory of the skies
for the love which from our birth
over and around us lies

and find there is none like you
there is none like you

and healing comes from your hands
suffering children are safe
in your arms
there is none like you

calm and sweet repose
with thy tenderest blessing
may mine eyelids close
 
  
  
 

grant to little children
visions bright of thee
guard the sailors tossing
on the deep blue sea
 
 
  
  

through the long night watches
may thine angels spread
their white wings above me
watching round my bed
 
    
 
  


when the morning wakens
then may i arise
pure and fresh and sinless
in thy holy eyes

fear not for i am with you

when you walk through the waters
i’ll be there
and through the flame

you’ll not no way be burnt
you’ll not no way be drowned
for i am with you
fear not

go at his command
  
  
   
 

he who gave his healing virtue
to a woman’s touch
to the faith that claims his fullness
still will give as much
     
 
      
  

yesterday today forever
jesus is the same
all may change but jesus never
glory to his name

  
   
   
  

glory to his name
glory to his name
all may change but jesus never
glory to his name
  
  
   
  

as of old he walked to emmaus
with them to abide
so through all life’s way he walketh
ever near our side
   
   
    
  

soon again we shall behold him
hasten lord the day
but ’twill still be this same jesus
as he went away
    
    
   
    

yesterday today forever
jesus is the same
all may change but jesus never
glory to his name

  
   
   
  


glory to his name
glory to his name
all may change but jesus never
glory to his name
  
  
   
  


jesus says to shine
with a pure clear light
like a little candle
burning in the night
  
  
 
   
   

in this world of darkness
so let us shine
you in your small corner
and i in mine
   
  
   
    

jesus says to shine
first of all for him
well he sees and knows it
if our light grows dim
  
  
    
 

he looks down from heaven
to see us shine
you in your small corner
and i in mine
    
   
   
    

jesus says to shine
then for all around
many kinds of darkness
in the world are found
  
   
   
  

sin and want and sorrow
so we must shine
you in your small corner
and i in mine
   
 
   
    
  
  
  
  

  
  
   
    


when i fear my faith will fail
christ will hold me fast
when the tempter would prevail
he can hold me fast
   
   
  
   
  

he will hold me fast
he will hold me fast
for my saviour loves me so
he will hold me fast

   
   
  
  

i could never keep my hold
he will hold me fast
for my love is often cold
he must hold me fast
  
  
    
  

he will hold me fast
he will hold me fast
for my saviour loves me so
he will hold me fast

   
   
  
  

i am precious in his sight
he will hold me fast
those he saves are his delight
he will hold me fast
     
  
   
  

he will hold me fast
he will hold me fast
for my saviour loves me so
he will hold me fast

   
   
  
  

he’ll not let my soul be lost
christ will hold me fast
bought by him at such a cost
he will hold me fast
    
  
    
  

he will hold me fast
he will hold me fast
for my saviour loves me so
he will hold me fast

   
   
  
  
   
   
  
 


he will hold me fast
he will hold me fast
for my saviour loves me so
he will hold me fast

and to my list’ning ears
all nature sings and round me rings
the music of the spheres

of rocks and trees of skies and seas
his hand the wonders wrought

the birds their carols raise
the morning light the lily white
declare their maker’s praise

in the rustling grass i hear him pass
he speaks to me everywhere

that though the wrong
seems oft so strong
god is the ruler yet

jesus who died shall be satisfied
and earth and heav’n be one

joy has dawned upon the world
promised from creation
god’s salvation now unfurled
hope for ev’ry nation

not with fanfares from above
not with scenes of glory
but a humble gift of love
jesus born of mary
  joy has dawned

sounds of wonder fill the sky
with the songs of angels
as the mighty prince of life
shelters in a stable

hands that set each star in place
shaped the earth in darkness
cling now to a mother’s breast
vulnerable and helpless

shepherds bow before the lamb
gazing at the glory
gifts of men from distant lands
prophesy the story

gold a king is born today
incense god is with us
myrrh his death will make a way
and by his blood he’ll win us


son of adam son of heav’n
given as a ransom
reconciling god and man
christ our mighty champion

what a saviour what a friend
what a glorious mystery
once a babe in bethlehem
now the lord of history


like a waterfall
is to one drop of rain
like a mountain tow’rs
above a single grain of sand

like the blazing sun
is to a candle flame
like a thousand years to one day
you are god and we are not
  like a waterfall
beyond sight beyond mind
beyond sense space and time
most beautiful mystery of all


you are god above
angels worship you
most beautiful mystery
three times holy god
god whose name is love
most beautiful mystery
you stride among the stars
you call them each by name
to you the galaxies
are only dust upon the scales

before the world was formed
not even day or night
and all the angels sang
with pure delight
you were there and we were not
beyond sight beyond mind
beyond sense space and time
most beautiful mystery of all


you are god above
angels worship you
most beautiful mystery
three times holy god
god whose name is love
most beautiful mystery


you are god my god
you are most beautiful mystery


you are god above
angels worship you
most beautiful mystery
three times holy god
god whose name is love
most beautiful mystery

i’ve found a friend o such a friend
he loved me ere i knew him
he drew me with the cords of love
and thus he bound me to him
   
   
     
    
   

and round my heart still closely twine
those ties which naught can sever
for i am his and he is mine
forever and forever
   
  
    
   

i’ve found a friend o such a friend
he bled he died to save me
and not alone the gift of life
but his own self he gave me
   
   
     
    

naught that i have mine own i call
i’ll hold it for the giver
my heart my strength my life my all
are his and his forever
    
  
   
   

i’ve found a friend o such a friend
all pow’r to him is given
to guard me on my onward course
and bring me safe to heaven
   
  
     
  

th’ eternal glories gleam afar
to nerve my faint endeavour
so now to watch to work to war
and then to rest forever
    
   
    
  

i’ve found a friend o such a friend
so kind and true and tender
so wise a counsellor and guide
so mighty a defender
   
  
   
   


from him who loves me now so well
what power my soul can sever
shall life or death shall earth or hell
no i am his forever
  
    
      
   


when i see the beauty
of a sunset’s glory
amazing artistry
across the evening sky

when i feel the mystery
of a distant galaxy
it awes and humbles me
to be loved by a god so high
  when i see the beauty

what can i do but give my life to you
hallelujah hallelujah
what can i do but praise you
every day make ev’rything i do
a hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah

when i hear the story
of a god of mercy
who shared humanity
and suffered by our side

of the cross they nailed you to
that could not hold you
now you’re making all things new
by the pow’r of your risen life



what can i do but thank you
what can i do but give my life to you
hallelujah hallelujah
what can i do but praise you
every day make ev’rything i do

o for a faith that will not shrink
tho’ pressed by ev’ry foe
that will not tremble on the brink
of any earthly woe
    
    
  
    
   

that will not murmur nor complain
beneath the chastening rod
but in the hour of grief or pain
will lean upon its god
     
  
  
   

a faith that shines more bright and clear
when tempests rage without
that when in danger knows no fear
in darkness feels no doubt
   
   
     
  


lord give us such a faith as this
and then whate’er may come
we’ll taste e’en here the hallowed bliss
of an eternal home
    
    
   
  



god is good all the time
he put a song of praise
in this heart of mine
god is good all the time
through the darkest night
his light will shine
god is good god is good
all the time
god is good all the time
if you’re walking
through the valley
and there are shadows all around
do not fear
he will guide you
he will keep you safe and sound
’cause he has promised
to never leave you
nor forsake you
and his word is true

god is good all the time
he put a song of praise
in this heart of mine
god is good all the time
through the darkest night
his light will shine
god is good god is good
all the time
we were sinners
so unworthy
still for us he chose to die
filled us with
his holy spirit
now we can stand and testify
that his love
is everlasting
and his mercies
they will never end

god is good all the time
he put a song of praise
in this heart of mine
god is good all the time
through the darkest night
his light will shine
god is good god is good
all the time



though i may not understand
all the plans you have for me
my life is in your hands
and through the eyes of faith
i can clearly see


god is good all the time
he put a song of praise
in this heart of mine
god is good all the time
through the darkest night
his light will shine
god is good god is good
god is good he’s so good
god is good he’s so good
all the time


it may not be on the mountain’s height
or over the stormy sea
it may not be at the battle’s front
my lord will have need of me
    
     
     
      
   
but if by a still small voice he calls
to paths i do not know
i’ll answer dear lord with my hand
in yours
i’ll go where you want me to go
    
   
    
    

i’ll go where you want me to go dear lord
o’er mountain or plain or sea
i’ll say what you want me to say dear lord
i’ll be what you want me to be

     
   
      
     

perhaps today there are loving words
which jesus would have me speak
there may be now in the paths of sin
some wand’rer whom i should seek
    
   
    
   

o saviour if you will be my guide
though dark and rugged the way
my voice shall echo the message sweet
i’ll say what you want me to say
    
    
      
     

i’ll go where you want me to go dear lord
o’er mountain or plain or sea
i’ll say what you want me to say dear lord
i’ll be what you want me to be

     
   
      
     

there’s surely somewhere a lowly place
in earth’s harvest fields so wide
where i may labour through life’s short day
for jesus the crucified
    
  
     
  

so trusting my all unto your care
i know you always love me
i’ll do your will with a heart sincere
i’ll be what you want me to be
   
   
     
     


i’ll go where you want me to go dear lord
o’er mountain or plain or sea
i’ll say what you want me to say dear lord
i’ll be what you want me to be

     
   
      
     


i will sing of my redeemer
and his wondrous love to me
on the cruel cross he suffered
from the curse to set me free
   
   
   
   
  

sing oh sing of my redeemer
with his blood he purchased me
on the cross he sealed my pardon
paid the debt and made me free

    
   
    
    

i will tell the wondrous story
how my lost estate to save
in his boundless love and mercy
he the ransom freely gave
  
    
    
   

sing oh sing of my redeemer
with his blood he purchased me
on the cross he sealed my pardon
paid the debt and made me free

    
   
    
    

i will praise my dear redeemer
his triumphant power i’ll tell
how the victory he giveth
over sin and death and hell
   
  
   
    

sing oh sing of my redeemer
with his blood he purchased me
on the cross he sealed my pardon
paid the debt and made me free

    
   
    
    

i will sing of my redeemer
and his heav’nly love to me
he from death to life hath brought me
son of god with him to be
   
  
    
    


sing oh sing of my redeemer
with his blood he purchased me
on the cross he sealed my pardon
paid the debt and made me free

    
   
    
    


brightly beams our father’s mercy
from his lighthouse evermore
but to us he gives the keeping
of the lights along the shore
-      
    
   ―
    
 

let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
for to us he gives the keeping
of the lights along the shore

    
   
   
   

dark the night of sin has settled
loud the angry billows roar
eager eyes are watching longing
for the lights along the shore
    
  
  
  

let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
eager eyes are watching longing
for the lights along the shore

    
   
   
   

trim your feeble lamp my brother
some poor sailor tempest tossed
trying now to make the harbour
in the darkness may be lost
    
  
    
’     


let the lower lights be burning
send a gleam across the wave
trying now to make the harbour
some poor sailor may be lost

    
   
   
   


who is on the lord’s side
who will serve the king
who will be his helpers
other lives to bring
   
   
  
   ―
 

who will leave the world’s side
who will face the foe
who is on the lord’s side
who for him will go
  
 
   
  

by thy call of mercy
by thy grace divine
we are on the lord’s side
saviour we are thine
  
   
  
  

not for weight of glory
not for crown and palm
enter we the army
raise the warrior psalm
   
  
 
 

but for love that claimeth
lives for whom he died
he whom jesus nameth
must be on his side
    
   
 
 

by thy love constraining
by thy grace divine
we are on the lord’s side
saviour we are thine
 
   
  
  

jesus thou hast bought us
not with gold or gem
but with thine own life-blood
for thy diadem
  
   
 
  

with thy blessing filling
each who comes to thee
thou hast made us willing
thou hast made us free
 
   
  
 

by thy grand redemption
by thy grace divine
we are on the lord’s side
saviour we are thine
 
   
  
  

fierce may be the conflict
strong may be the foe
but the king’s own army
none can overthrow
   
  
  
  

’round his standard ranging
victory to secure
for his truth unchanging
makes the triumph sure
  
  
    
 


joyfully enlisting
by thy grace divine
we are on the lord’s side
saviour we are thine

one sat alone beside the highway begging
his eyes were blind the light he could not see
he clutched his rags and shivered in the
shadows
then jesus came and bade his darkness flee
 
    
       
     
      

when jesus comes the tempter’s power is
broken
when jesus comes the tears are wiped away
he takes the gloom and fills the life with glory
for all is changed when jesus comes to stay

      
    
    
      

from home and friends the evil spirits
drove him
among the tombs he dwelt in misery
he cut himself as demon powers possessed him
then jesus came and set the captive free
     
    
     
     

when jesus comes the tempter’s power is
broken
when jesus comes the tears are wiped away
he takes the gloom and fills the life with glory
for all is changed when jesus comes to stay

      
    
    
      

“unclean unclean” the leper cried in torment
the deaf the dumb in helplessness stood near
the fever raged disease had gripped its victim
then jesus came and cast out every fear 
    

     
      
     

when jesus comes the tempter’s power is
broken
when jesus comes the tears are wiped away
he takes the gloom and fills the life with glory
for all is changed when jesus comes to stay

      
    
    
      

their hearts were sad as in the tomb they
laid him
for death had come and taken him away
their night was dark and bitter tears were falling
then jesus came and night was turned to day
       

       
    
      

when jesus comes the tempter’s power is
broken
when jesus comes the tears are wiped away
he takes the gloom and fills the life with glory
for all is changed when jesus comes to stay

      
    
    
      

so men today have found the saviour able
they could not conquer passion lust and sin
their broken hearts had left them sad and
lonely
then jesus came and dwelt himself within 
      
      
      
      


when jesus comes the tempter’s power is
broken
when jesus comes the tears are wiped away
he takes the gloom and fills the life with glory
for all is changed when jesus comes to stay

      
    
    
      


to god be the glory
to god be the glory
to god be the glory
for the things he has done
    
 
 
 
    


by his blood he has saved me
by his power he has raised me
to god be the glory
for the things he has done
   
   
 
    



god’s not dead no he is alive
god’s not dead no he is alive
god’s not dead no he is alive

praise him with my mouth
praise him with my feet
praise him with my hands
love him in my life
jesus is alive in me
god’s not dead


wildly life’s billows ’round my soul are beating
fierce is the tempest dangerous is the sea
driven by terror i come to thee pleading
“father in heaven o hear thou my plea”
 
   
   
     
     

in thy great mercy help me i implore thee
long have i struggled but to no avail
my strength is spenti cast myself before thee
“help me my father without thee i fall”
     
      
      
    


into the calmness of thy harbour guide me
instil a peace and trust within my soul
amid life’s tempest stay thou o’er beside me
bring me at last to my heavenly goal

who thro’ life has been my guide

more love to thee
     
   
 
  


he lives he lives
he triumphed over death
he lives he lives
the lord revealed his strength
   

   
   
   
   

he lives he lives
enthroned above all earthly strife
he leads us to eternal life
   
 
     

the wicked hands of sinners
had nailed him to the tree
our guilt and our transgressions
had caused his agony
  
  
  
  

the sweat like blood was flowing
from his disfigured brow
his task was done
oh praise him now
  
    
    

he lives he lives
he triumphed over death
he lives he lives
the lord revealed his strength

   
   
   
   

he lives he lives
enthroned above all earthly strife
he leads us to eternal life
   
 
     

his body then was taken
by joseph from the cross
in his own tomb he laid it
not counting it a loss
  
    
   
   

but suddenly the sun shone
and darkness took its flight
the lord had said
“let there be light”
   
   
    

he lives he lives
he triumphed over death
he lives he lives
the lord revealed his strength

   
   
   
   

he lives he lives
enthroned above all earthly strife
he leads us to eternal life
   
 
     

at dawn there came with mary
some women to the tomb
an angel stood beside them
and scattered all their gloom
   
   
  
   

“go quickly tell the others
that he is risen from the dead”
and death forever
lost its dread
  
   
   

he lives he lives
he triumphed over death
he lives he lives
the lord revealed his strength

   
   
   
   

he lives he lives
enthroned above all earthly strife
he leads us to eternal life
   
 
     

as mary stands bewildered
still grieving in her heart
she sees her risen saviour
and can’t contain her start
   
  
   
   

she shouts in exultation
“my master and my lord”
and quickly runs
to spread the word
   
  
    

he lives he lives
he triumphed over death
he lives he lives
the lord revealed his strength

   
   
   
   


he lives he lives
enthroned above all earthly strife
he leads us to eternal life
   
 
     


sinners jesus will receive
sound this word of grace to all
who the heavenly pathway leave
all who linger all who fall
  
   
    
    
   

sing it o’er and over again
christ receiveth sinful men
make the message clear and plain
christ receiveth sinful men

   
   
   
   

come and he will give you rest
trust him for his word is plain
he will take the sinfulest
christ receiveth sinful men
    
  
   
   

sing it o’er and over again
christ receiveth sinful men
make the message clear and plain
christ receiveth sinful men

   
   
   
   

now my heart condemns me not
pure before the law i stand
he who cleansed me from all spot
satisfied its last demand
   
   
    
   

sing it o’er and over again
christ receiveth sinful men
make the message clear and plain
christ receiveth sinful men

   
   
   
   

christ receiveth sinful men
even me with all my sin
purged from every spot and stain
heaven with him i enter in
  
  
   
   


sing it o’er and over again
christ receiveth sinful men
make the message clear and plain
christ receiveth sinful men

   
   
   
   


ho my comrades see the signal
waving in the sky
reinforcements now appearing
victory is nigh
  
  
   
  
  

“hold the fort for i am coming”
jesus signals still
wave the answer back to heaven
“by thy grace we will”

   
  
   
  

see the mighty host advancing
satan leading on
mighty ones around us falling
courage almost gone
    
 
  
   

“hold the fort for i am coming”
jesus signals still
wave the answer back to heaven
“by thy grace we will”

   
  
   
  

see the glorious banner waving
hear the trumpet blow
in our leader’s name we triumph
over ev’ry foe
  
 
   
  

“hold the fort for i am coming”
jesus signals still
wave the answer back to heaven
“by thy grace we will”

   
  
   
  

fierce and long the battle rages
but our help is near
onward comes our great commander
cheer my comrades cheer
   
  
   
 

“hold the fort for i am coming”
jesus signals still
wave the answer back to heaven
“by thy grace we will”

   
  
   
  
     
  
      
 


“hold the fort for i am coming”
jesus signals still
wave the answer back to heaven
“by thy grace we will”

bid sadness and sorrow depart
 
  
  
   
     

rejoice rejoice
be glad in the lord and rejoice

rejoice rejoice

be glad in the lord and rejoice

 
   
 
   

what though in the conflict for right
your enemies almost prevail
god’s armies just hid from your sight
are more than the foes which assail
     
    
  
   

rejoice rejoice
be glad in the lord and rejoice
rejoice rejoice
be glad in the lord and rejoice

 
   
 
   

be glad in the lord and rejoice
his praises proclaiming in song
with harp and with organ and voice
the loud hallelujahs prolong

be glad in the lord and rejoice

 
   
 
   

who is there like you o god

you know the way though it is hidden from me
since you are there my heart is filled with peace
why should i fear when you go on before me
both night and day you set my heart at ease
  
       
    
     
      

you know the way the time of my translation
was planned before i even lived one day
my heart is filled with wonder and elation
for you have loved and led me all the way
      
      
     
    

lord you know all the winds that blow and
frighten
the storms of life your orders still obey
and even though my burdens may not lighten
still i’m at peace because you know the way
     
    
     
      


there were ninety and nine that safely lay
in the shelter of the fold
but one was out on the hills away
far off from the gates of gold
  
   
     
     
     

away on the mountains wild and bare
away from the tender shepherd’s care
away from the tender shepherd’s care
    
     
     
lord thou hast here thy ninety and nine
are they not enough for thee
but the shepherd made answer
“this of mine
has wandered away from me
   
   
      
     

and although the road be rough and steep
i go to the desert to find my sheep
i go to the desert to find my sheep”
       
    
    
but none of the ransomed ever knew
how deep were the waters crossed
nor how dark was the night
that the lord passed thro’
ere he found his sheep that was lost
     
     
       
    

out in the desert he heard its cry
sick and helpless and ready to die
sick and helpless and ready to die
    
      
      
lord whence are those blood drops
all the way
that mark out the mountain’s track
they were shed for one who had gone
astray
ere the shepherd could bring him back

    
    
     
    

lord whence are thy hands so rent
and torn
they’re pierced tonight by many a thorn
they’re pierced tonight by many a thorn
     
     
     
but all thro’ the mountains thunder riv’n
and up from the rocky steep
there arose a glad cry to the gate
of heav’n
“rejoice i have found my sheep”
    
     
      
   


and the angels echoed around the throne
“rejoice for the lord brings back his own
rejoice for the lord brings back his own”
     
   
   


jesus my lord to thee i cry
unless thou help me i must die
oh bring thy free salvation nigh
and take me as i am
   
   
      
    
   

and take me as i am
and take me as i am
my only pleachrist died for me
oh take me as i am

   
   
    
   

helpless i am and full of guilt
but yet for me thy blood was spilt
and thou canst make me what thou wilt
and take me as i am
    
    
   
   

and take me as i am
and take me as i am
my only pleachrist died for me
oh take me as i am

   
   
    
   

no preparation can i make
my best resolves i only break
yet save me for thine own name’s sake
and take me as i am
   
    
     
   

and take me as i am
and take me as i am
my only pleachrist died for me
oh take me as i am

   
   
    
   

behold me saviour at thy feet
deal with me as thou seest meet
thy work begin thy work complete
and take me as i am
     
  
    
   


and take me as i am
and take me as i am
my only pleachrist died for me
oh take me as i am

   
   
    
   


i heard the voice of jesus say
“come unto me and rest
lay down thou weary one lay down
thy head upon my breast”
   
   
    
    
  

i came to jesus as i was
weary and worn and sad
i found in him a resting place
and he has made me glad
    
   
     
   

i heard the voice of jesus say
“behold i freely give
the living water thirsty one
stoop down and drink and live”
   
  
   
  

i came to jesus and i drank
of that life-giving stream
my thirst was quenched my soul revived
and now i live in him
     
  
     
   

i heard the voice of jesus say
“i am this dark world’s light
look unto me thy morn shall rise
and all thy day be bright”
   
     
    
   


i looked to jesus and i found
in him my star my sun
and in that light of life i’ll walk
till travelling days are done

“salvation is free”
   
 
   
  


toiling on toiling on
let us hope and trust
let us watch and pray
and labour till the master comes

     
   
  
   

jesus saviour pilot me
over life’s tempestuous sea
unknown waves before me roll
hiding rocks and treach’rous shoal
chart and compass come from thee
jesus saviour pilot me
    
    
  
   
   
   
    
as a mother stills her child
thou canst hush the ocean wild
boist’rous waves obey thy will
when thou say’st to them “be still”
wondrous sov’reign of the sea
jesus saviour pilot me
   
   
   
 
  
    

when at last i near the shore
and the fearful breakers roar
’twixt me and the peaceful rest
then while leaning on thy breast
may i hear thee say to me
“fear not i will pilot thee”
     
   
   
    
   
    


have your sins been washed in the flow
from the cross on dark calvary
and the one who died do you know
that from sin you might ransomed be
    
    
    
    
    

though like scarlet your sins may be
heavy though the weight of your woe
his blood can make you free from sin
it can make them whiter than snow

     
   
   
    

on the cross forsaken was he
from the cross his blood trickled down
that mankind from sin could be free
for the cross exchanged he his crown
  
   
    
   

though like scarlet your sins may be
heavy though the weight of your woe
his blood can make you free from sin
it can make them whiter than snow

     
   
   
    

jesus called and i did reply
“come to me” he saidi did go
what i was no longer am i
his blood made me whiter than snow
    
    
    
    

though like scarlet your sins may be
heavy though the weight of your woe
his blood can make you free from sin
it can make them whiter than snow

     
   
   
    

like the wayward lamb i had strayed
“pastures green” were silver and gold
on the cross atonement was made
jesus brought me back to the fold
    
   
    
     

though like scarlet your sins may be
heavy though the weight of your woe
his blood can make you free from sin
it can make them whiter than snow

     
   
   
    

contemplating i love to see
from the cross the life-giving flow
to us bringing grace full and free
by it making us white as snow
   
   
     
    


though like scarlet your sins may be
heavy though the weight of your woe
his blood can make you free from sin
it can make them whiter than snow

     
   
   
    


on a hill far away
stood an old rugged cross
the emblem of suffering and shame
and i love that old cross
where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain
    

      
    
       
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

   
    
    
    

oh that old rugged cross
so despised by the world
has a wondrous attraction for me
for the dear lamb of god left his glory above
to bear it to dark calvary
     

      
        
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

   
    
    
    
in that old rugged cross
stained with blood so divine
a wondrous beauty i see
for ’twas on that old cross
jesus suffered and died
to pardon and sanctify me
     
 
     
     
    

so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

   
    
    
    

to the old rugged cross i will ever be true
it’s shame and reproach gladly bear
then he’ll call me some day
to my home far away
where his glory forever i’ll share
     

     
      
     


so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

oh teach me from my heart to say
“thy will be done”
   
   
    
  
  

thy will be done
thy will be done
oh teach me from my heart to say
“thy will be done”

what most i prized it ne’er was mine
i have but yielded what was thine
“thy will be done”
    
     
    
  

thy will be done

all that now makes it hard to say
“thy will be done”

the prayer oft mixed with tears before
i’ll sing upon a happier shore
“thy will be done”

i’ll sing upon a happier shore

what means this eager anxious throng
which moves with busy haste along
these wondrous gatherings day by day
what means this strange commotion pray
   
   
-    
   
   

in accents hushed the throng reply
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”
in accents hushed the throng reply
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”
    
  
    
  

who is this jesus why should he
the city move so mightily
a passing stranger has he skill
to move the multitude at will
     
   
   
   

again the stirring tones reply
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”
again the stirring tones reply
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”
    
  
    
  

jesus ’tis he who once below
man’s pathway trod ’mid pain and woe
and burdened ones where’er he came
brought out their sick and deaf and lame
     
    
   
   

the blind rejoiced to hear the cry
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”
the blind rejoiced to hear the cry
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”
   
  
   
  

again he comes from place to place
his holy footprints we can trace
he pauseth at our thresholdnay
he enterscondescends to stay
    
    
    
      

shall we not gladly raise the cry
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”
shall we not gladly raise the cry
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”

here’s pardon comfort rest and home

return accept his proffered grace
   
     
    
    

ye tempted ones there’s refuge nigh
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”
ye tempted ones there’s refuge nigh
“jesus of nazareth passeth by”
     
  
     
  

but if you still his call refuse
and all his wondrous love abuse
soon will he sadly from you turn
your bitter prayer for pardon spurn
   
   
  
    


“too late too late” will be the cry
“jesus of nazareth has passed by”
“too late too late” will be the cry
“jesus of nazareth has passed by”

and wonders of his love
and wonders of his love

i cannot tell
how he whom angels worship
should stoop to love
the peoples of the earth
or why as shepherd
he should seek the wand’rer
with his mysterious
promise of new birth
i cannot tell

but this i know
that he was born of mary
when bethl’em’s manger
was his only home
and that he lived
at nazareth and laboured
and so the saviour
saviour of the world is come

i cannot tell
how silently he suffered
as with his peace
he graced this place of tears
or how his heart
upon the cross was broken
the crown of pain
to three and thirty years

but this i know
he heals the broken-hearted
and stays our sin
and calms our lurking fear
and lifts the burden
from the heavy laden
for yet the saviour
saviour of the world is here

i cannot tell
how he will win the nations
how he will claim
his earthly heritage
how satisfy the needs
and aspirations
of east and west
of sinner and of sage

but this i know
all flesh shall see his glory
and he shall reap
the harvest he has sown
and some glad day
his sun shall shine in splendour
when he the saviour
saviour of the world is known

i cannot tell
how all the lands shall worship
when at his bidding
ev’ry storm is stilled
or who can say
how great the jubilation
when ev’ry heart
with perfect love is filled


but this i know
the skies will thrill with rapture
and myriad myriad
human voices sing
and earth to heav’n
and heav’n to earth will answer
“at last the saviour
saviour of the world is king”


take me past the outer courts
and through the holy place
past the brazen altar
lord i want to see your face

pass me by the crowds of people
and the priests who sing their praise
i hunger and thirst for your righteousness
but it’s only found one place
  take me past the outer courts



so take me in to the holy of holies
take me in by the blood of the lamb
so take me in to the holy of holies
take the coal cleanse my lips
here i am



is it true today
that when people pray
cloudless skies will break
kings and queens will shake
yes it’s true and i believe it
i’m living for you
is it true today


well it’s true today
that when people pray
we’ll see dead men rise
and the blind set free
yes it’s true and i believe it
i’m living for you

i’m going to be a history maker
in this land
i’m going to be a speaker of truth
to all mankind

i’m going to stand
i’m going to run into your arms
into your arms again
into your arms into your arms again
well it’s true today
that when people stand
with the fire of god
and the truth in hand

we’ll see miracles
we’ll see angels sing
we’ll see broken hearts
making history
yes it’s true and i believe it
i’m living for you



i’m going to be a history maker
in this land
i’m going to be a speaker of truth
to all mankind

i’m going to stand
i’m going to run into your arms
into your arms again
into your arms into your arms again


when jesus i knew not i did not know life
i spent all my days in contention and strife
then i heard a voice which all trouble surmounts
“he loves you he loves you”
how sweetly it sounds
-     
       
     
      
„     ”

in sin i was dead
but now i am saved
“he loves you he loves you”
how sweetly it sounds

and wrongs
and nowhere my spirit finds solace and songs
this message from heaven in echo resounds
“he loves you he loves you”
how sweetly it sounds
      
      
     
„   ”  


in sin i was dead
but now i am saved
“he loves you he loves you”

i am a stranger here within a foreign land
my home is far away upon a golden strand
ambassador to be of realms beyond the sea
i’m here on business for my king
   
       
      
     
  

this is the message that i bring
a message angels fain would sing
“oh be ye reconciled”
thus saith my lord and king
“oh be ye reconciled to god”

   
   
   
   
   
this is the king’s command that all men
everywhere
repent and turn away from sin’s seductive snare
that all who will obey with him shall reign for
aye
and that’s my business for my king
     
     
      
  

this is the message that i bring
a message angels fain would sing
“oh be ye reconciled”
thus saith my lord and king
“oh be ye reconciled to god”

   
   
   
   
   

my home is brighter far than sharon’s rosy plain
eternal life and joy throughout its vast domain
my sovereign bids me tell how mortals there
may dwell
and that’s my business for my king
      
      
      
  


this is the message that i bring
a message angels fain would sing
“oh be ye reconciled”
thus saith my lord and king

i will enter his gates
with thanksgiving in my heart
i will enter his courts with praise
i will say this is the day
that the lord has made
i will rejoice for he has made me glad

he has made me glad
he has made me glad
i will rejoice for he has made me glad

me from my sin

blessd be the fountain of blood
to a world of sinners revealed
blessd be the dear son of god
only by his stripes we are healed
    
    
   
    
  

tho’ i’ve wandered far from his fold
bringing to my heart pain and woe
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow
  
   
  
    

whiter than the snow
whiter than the snow
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow

   
  
    

thorny was the crown that he wore
and the cross his body o’ercame
grievous were the sorrows he bore
but he suffered thus not in vain
   
    
    
   

may i to that fountain be led
made to cleanse my sins here below
wash me in the blood that he shed
and i shall be whiter than snow
   
    
  
    

whiter than the snow
whiter than the snow
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow

   
  
    

father i have wandered from thee
often has my heart gone astray
crimson do my sins seem to me
water cannot wash them away
    
   
    
    

jesus to the fountain of thine
leaning on thy promise i go
cleanse me by thy washing divine
and i shall be whiter than snow
  
    
  
    


whiter than the snow
whiter than the snow
wash me in the blood of the lamb
and i shall be whiter than snow

i’ve found a friend o such a friend
he loved me ere i knew him
he drew me with the cords of love

those ties which naught can sever
for i am his and he is mine

all pow’r to him is given
to guard me on my onward course
and bring me safe to heaven

to nerve my faint endeavour
so now to watch to work to war
and then to rest forever
  
  
      
  

i’ve found a friend o such a friend
so kind and true and tender
so wise a counsellor and guide
so mighty a defender
   
   
    
 


from him who loves me now so well
what power my soul can sever
shall life or death shall earth or hell
no i am his forever

did you feel the mountains tremble
did you hear the oceans roar
when the people rose to sing of
jesus christ the risen one

did you feel the people tremble
did you hear the singers roar
when the lost began to sing of
jesus christ the saving one

  did you feel the mountains


and we can see that god
you’re moving
a mighty river through the nations
and young and old will turn to jesus

fling wide you heavenly gates
prepare the way of the risen lord


open up the doors and
let the music play
let the streets resound with singing
songs that bring your hope
songs that bring your joy
dancers who dance upon injustice



do you feel the darkness tremble
when all the saints join in one song
and all the streams flow as one river
to wash away our brokenness



and we can see that god
you’re moving
a time of jubilee is coming
when young and old will turn to jesus

fling wide you heavenly gates
prepare the way of the risen lord



open up the doors and
let the music play
let the streets resound with singing
songs that bring your hope
songs that bring your joy
dancers who dance upon injustice


up calvary’s mountain one dreadful morn
walked christ my saviour weary and worn
facing for sinners death on the cross
that he might save them from endless loss
  
   
     
    
     

blessd redeemer precious redeemer
seems now i see him on calvary’s tree
wounded and bleeding for sinners pleading
blind and unheedingdying for me

   
     
    
     

“father forgive them” thus did he pray
e’en while his lifeblood flowed fast away
praying for sinners while in such woe
no one but jesus ever loved so
     
     
    
     

blessd redeemer precious redeemer
seems now i see him on calvary’s tree
wounded and bleeding for sinners pleading
blind and unheedingdying for me

   
     
    
     

o how i love him saviour and friend
how can my praises ever find end
through years unnumbered on heaven’s
shore
my tongue shall praise him forevermore
     
     
      
     


blessd redeemer precious redeemer
seems now i see him on calvary’s tree

all the burdens of my heart rolled away
rolled away rolled away rolled away

in the silent midnight watches
standing at your door
calls the saviour pleading knocking
now as oft before
   
   
   
   
  

he would enter with salvation
heart oppressed by sin
open now the door for jesus
let him enter in
  
  
   
  

death will come some day relentless
come to every man
none can heedlessly ignore him
none his entry ban
   
  
    
   

jesus waits in mercy pleading
at the door today
him not death the cruel reaper
you can turn away
   
  
   
  

when you hear the saviour knocking
calling at your door
o receive him let him enter
and your soul restore
   
   
   
  

then when breaks the golden morning
bright eternal fair
he will open heaven’s portals
and receive you there

to the farthest horizon
and his love it reaches to me

on the pathway to heaven

his love is better
than the choicest of wine

his love it satisfies
the deepest of hunger
and his love in jesus it’s mine

there is a fountain filled with blood
drawn from emmanuel’s veins
and sinners plunged beneath that flood
lose all their guilty stains
   
   
  
    
   

the dying thief rejoiced to see
that fountain in his day
and there may i though vile as he
wash all my sins away
    
    
     
   

dear dying lamb thy precious blood
shall never lose its pow’r
till all the ransomed church of god
are saved to sin no more
   
   
    
  

e’er since by faith i saw the stream
thy flowing wounds supply
redeeming love has been my theme
and shall be till i die
   
   
   
  
when this poor lisping
stammering tongue
lies silent in the grave
then in a nobler sweeter song
i’ll sing thy power to save

speaks all the promises

where jesus shed his blood for me
o calvary blest calvary
’twas there my saviour died for me

with sweetness fills my breast
but sweeter far thy face to see
and in thy presence rest

nor can the mem’ry find
a sweeter sound than thy blest name

the wonder of your cross
shall be our meditation
to gather in that shadow
as the sun went down

to weep with those who thought
that you were leaving
you were leaving jesus
the humble king
who never wore an earthly crown
  the wonder of your cross
to steal away at night
when they took down your body
with love and tears to leave you
in a borrowed grave

to go with mary to
that place they laid you
where they laid you jesus
and in the morning
find the stone was rolled away



the cross o the wonderful cross
what glory what victory i’ve found
i’ll come to the wonderful cross
and my whole life i lay down
were heaven’s praises silent
in those hours of darkness
your holy spirit brooding
’round that empty throne

until the declaration
“he is risen”
you are risen jesus
he is not dead
behold he lives for evermore




the cross o the wonderful cross
what glory what victory i’ve found
i’ll come to the wonderful cross
and my whole life i lay down

i could sing of your love for ever

over the mountains and the sea
your river runs with love for me
and i will open up my heart
and let the healer set me free

i’m happy to be in the truth
and i will daily lift my hands
for i will always sing of
when your love came down



i could sing of your love for ever
i could sing of your love for ever
i could sing of your love for ever
i could sing of your love for ever



o i feel like dancing
it’s foolishness i know
but when the world has seen the light
they will dance with joy
like we’re dancing now




i could sing of your love for ever
i could sing of your love for ever
i could sing of your love for ever
i could sing of your love for ever


i will sing the wondrous story
of the christ who died for me
how he left his home in glory
for the cross of calvary
    
    
  
     
    

yes i’ll sing the wondrous story
of the christ who died for me
sing it with the saints in glory
gathered by the crystal sea

found the sheep that went astray
threw his loving arms around me
drew me back into his way
    
  
   
    

yes i’ll sing the wondrous story
of the christ who died for me
sing it with the saints in glory
gathered by the crystal sea

sight was gone and fears possessed me
but he freed me from them all
     
   
  
    

yes i’ll sing the wondrous story
of the christ who died for me
sing it with the saints in glory
gathered by the crystal sea

sorrow’s path i often tread
but his presence still is with me
by his guiding hand i’m led
    
     
   
   

yes i’ll sing the wondrous story
of the christ who died for me
sing it with the saints in glory
gathered by the crystal sea

   
    
    
  

he will keep me till the river
rolls its waters at my feet
then he’ll bear me safely over
where the loved ones i shall meet
     
   
    
   


yes i’ll sing the wondrous story
of the christ who died for me
sing it with the saints in glory
gathered by the crystal sea

   
    
    
  


“must i go and empty handed”
thus my dear redeemer meet
not one day of service give him
lay no trophy at his feet
    
    
   
     
    

“must i go and empty handed”
must i meet my saviour so
not one soul with which to greet him
must i empty handed go

    
   
    
 

not at death i shrink or falter
for my saviour saves me now
but to meet him empty handed
thought of that now clouds my brow
   
    
    
    

“must i go and empty handed”
must i meet my saviour so
not one soul with which to greet him
must i empty handed go

    
   
    
 

o the years in sinning wasted
could i but recall them now
i would give them to my saviour
to his will i’d gladly bow
    
  
    
   

“must i go and empty handed”
must i meet my saviour so
not one soul with which to greet him
must i empty handed go

    
   
    
 

o ye saints arouse be earnest
up and work while yet ’tis day
ere the night of death o’ertake thee
strive for souls while still you may
   
   
    
   


“must i go and empty handed”
must i meet my saviour so
not one soul with which to greet him
must i empty handed go

    
   
    
 


loved with everlasting love
led by grace that love to know
spirit breathing from above
thou hast taught me it is so
  
  
  
    
  
o this full and perfect peace
from his presence all divine

in a love which cannot cease
i am his and he is mine   
   
  

    
     
heav’n above is softer blue
earth around is sweeter green
something lives in every hue
christless eyes have never seen
   
   
   
   
birds with gladder songs o’erflow
flow’rs with deeper beauties shine

since i know as i now know
i am his and he is mine   
  
    

   
     
things that once were wild alarms
cannot now disturb my rest
closed in everlasting arms
pillowed on the loving breast
   
   
    
     
o to lie forever here
doubt and care and self resign

while he whispers in my ear
i am his and he is mine   
    
   

    
     
his forever only his
who the lord and me shall part
ah with what a rest of bliss
christ can fill the loving heart
   
   
     
    

heav’n and earth may fade and flee
first-born light in gloom decline

but while god and i shall be
i am his and he is mine   
   
    

    
     


deeper than the deepest of the oceans
everlasting deep beyond compare
higher than the highest lights of heaven
is the love that christ with us does share
    
    
  
     
  

he has cleansed me from sin’s blight
and given me robes of pure white
and his holy spirit gave to me
i now am in his family

   
   
   
   

dark and fearful striking me with terror
were the years that i had spent in sin
i was lost unfortunate and hopeless
jesus found me and he took me in
   
     
   
     

he has cleansed me from sin’s blight
and given me robes of pure white
and his holy spirit gave to me
i now am in his family

   
   
   
   

praise the lord for by the grace of jesus
i am saved from sin and death set free
over me sin has no more dominion
jesus christ my saviour dwells in me
   
     
    
     


he has cleansed me from sin’s blight
and given me robes of pure white
and his holy spirit gave to me
i now am in his family

the love of god is greater far
than tongue or pen can ever tell
it goes beyond the highest star
and reaches to the lowest hell
    
  
    
   
   

the guilty pair bowed down with care
god gave his son to win
his erring child he reconciled
and pardoned from his sin
     
    
    
  

o love of god how rich and pure
how measureless and strong
it shall forevermore endure
the saints’ and angels’ song

  
  
   
   

when years of time shall pass away
and earthly thrones and kingdoms fall
when men who here refuse to pray
on rocks and hills and mountains call
   
  
  
   

god’s love so sure shall still endure
all measureless and strong
redeeming grace to adam’s race
the saints’ and angels’ song
    
  
    
   

o love of god how rich and pure
how measureless and strong
it shall forevermore endure
the saints’ and angels’ song

  
  
   
   

could we with ink the ocean fill
and were the skies of parchment made
were ev’ry stalk on earth a quill
and ev’ry man a scribe by trade
    
   
      
   

to write the love of god above
would drain the ocean dry
nor could the scroll contain the whole
tho’ stretched from sky to sky

give me the wings of faith to rise
within the veil to see
the saints above how great their joys
how bright their glories be
  
    
  
    
   

many are the friends who are waiting today
happy on the golden strand
many are the voices calling us away
to join their glorious band

    
   
    
  

once they were mourners here below
and poured out cries and tears
they wrestled hard as we do now
with sins and doubts and fears
    
   
   
  

many are the friends who are waiting today
happy on the golden strand
many are the voices calling us away
to join their glorious band

    
   
    
  

i asked them whence their vict’ry came
they with united breath
ascribe their conquest to the lamb
their triumph to his death
    
  
    
   


many are the friends who are waiting today
happy on the golden strand
many are the voices calling us away
to join their glorious band

for god has promised rest for all
who enter paradise
   
   
    
      

the days are long the battle fierce
and i must do my part
on earth i find no resting place
or healing for my heart
    
    
   
  

maybe soon very soon
i must take my flight
at last to enter into rest
my father’s house of light
   
  
    
   


what human eye has never seen
no human ear has heard
what human mind could not conceive
god promised in his word

and crowned us with eternal life

and though your soul
was overwhelmed with pain
obedient to death you overcame
  you chose the cross


i’m lost in wonder
i’m lost in love
i’m lost in praise for evermore

because of jesus’ unfailing love
i am forgiven
i am restored
you loosed the cords of sinfulness
and broke the chains of my disgrace
you chose the cross

up from the grave victorious
you rose again so glorious
you chose the cross

the sorrow that surrounded you
was mine
“yet not my will but yours be done”
you said



i’m lost in wonder
i’m lost in love
i’m lost in praise for evermore

because of jesus’ unfailing love
i am forgiven
i am restored


there’s a dear and precious book
though it’s worn and faded now
which recalls those happy days of long ago
when i stood at mother’s knee
with her hand upon my brow
and i heard her voice in gentle tones and low
-     
   
   
   
    
   
    


blessd book precious book
on thy dear old tear stained leaves i love to look
thou art sweeter day by day
as i walk the narrow way
that leads at last to that bright home above

   
     
   
    
       

then she read of jesus’ love
as he blessed the children dear
how he suffered bled and died upon the tree
of his heavy load of care
then she dried my flowing tears
with her kisses as she said it was for me

and ever in my heart his words abide

o boundless salvation deep ocean of love
o fullness of mercy christ brought from above
the whole world redeeming so rich and so free
now flowing for all men
come roll over me
    
    
     
      
   
 

my sins they are many their stains are so deep
and bitter the tears of remorse that i weep
but useless is weeping thou great crimson sea
thy waters can cleanse me
come roll over me
      
     
      
  
  
my tempers are fitful my passions are strong
they bind my poor soul and they force
me to wrong
beneath thy blest billows deliverance i see
o come mighty ocean
and roll over me
    
     
      
 
 
now tossed with temptation then haunted
with fears
my life has been joyless and useless for years
i feel something better most surely would be
if once thy pure waters
would roll over me
     
     
     
   
   

the tide is now flowing i’m touching the wave
i hear the loud call of the mighty to save
my faith’s growing bolder delivered i’ll be
i plunge ’neath the waters
they roll over me
      
      
       
   
  


and now hallelujah the rest of my days
shall gladly be spent in promoting his praise

there are lonely hearts to cherish
while the days are going by
there are weary souls who perish
while the days are going by
 
 
   
    
   

if a smile we can renew
as our journey we pursue
oh the good we all may do
while the days are going by
   
    
   
   

going by going by going by going by
going by going by going by going by
oh the good we all may do
while the days are going by

   
   
   
   

there’s no time for idle scorning
while the days are going by
let your face be like the morning
while the days are going by
    
   
   
   

oh the world is full of sighs
full of sad and weeping eyes
help your fallen brother rise
while the days are going by
     
   
   
   

going by going by going by going by
going by going by going by going by
oh the good we all may do
while the days are going by

   
   
   
   

all the loving links that bind us
while the days are going by
one by one we leave behind us
while the days are going by
  
   
   
   

but the seeds of good we sow
both in shade and shine will grow
and will keep our hearts aglow
while the days are going by
    
   
    
   


going by going by going by going by
going by going by going by going by
oh the good we all may do
while the days are going by

when the storms of life are raging
tempests wild on sea and land
i will seek a place of refuge
in the shadow of god’s hand
    
    
  
   
  

he will hide me he will hide me
where no harm can e’er betide me
he will hide me safely hide me
in the shadow of his hand

   
   
  
   

enemies may strive to injure
satan all his arts employ
he will turn what seems to harm me
into everlasting joy
   
  
   
    

he will hide me he will hide me
where no harm can e’er betide me
he will hide me safely hide me
in the shadow of his hand

   
   
  
   

tho’ he may send some affliction
’twill but make me long for home
for in love and not in anger
all his chastenings will come
    
    
   
   

he will hide me he will hide me
where no harm can e’er betide me
he will hide me safely hide me
in the shadow of his hand

   
   
  
   

so while here the cross i’m bearing
meeting storms and billows wild
jesus for my soul is caring
naught can harm his father’s child
    
   
    
    


he will hide me he will hide me
where no harm can e’er betide me
he will hide me safely hide me
in the shadow of his hand

   
   
  
   

sweet hour of prayer
sweet hour of prayer
that calls me from a world of care
and bids me at my father’s throne
make all my wants and wishes known
 
   
   
   
  
in seasons of distress and grief
my soul has often found relief
and oft escaped the tempter’s snare
by thy return sweet hour of prayer
    
   
    
    
sweet hour of prayer
sweet hour of prayer
thy wings shall my petition bear
to him whose truth and faithfulness
engage the waiting soul to bless
   
    
     
   
and since he bids me seek his face
believe his word and trust his grace
i’ll cast on him my ev’ry care
and wait for thee sweet hour of prayer
   
    
   
    
sweet hour of prayer
sweet hour of prayer
may i thy consolation share
’til from mount pisgah’s lofty height
i view my home and take my flight
   
    
   
    

this robe of flesh i’ll drop and rise
to seize the everlasting prize
and shout while passing through the air
farewell farewell sweet hour of prayer
   
     
    
   


i can hear my saviour calling
i can hear my saviour calling
i can hear my saviour calling
“take thy cross and follow follow me”
  
  
  
  
  
   

where he leads me i will follow
where he leads me i will follow
where he leads me i will follow
i’ll go with him with him all the way
    
    
    
     

i’ll go with him through the garden
i’ll go with him through the garden
i’ll go with him through the garden
i’ll go with him with him all the way
     
     
     
     

i’ll go with him through the judgement
i’ll go with him through the judgement
i’ll go with him through the judgement
i’ll go with him with him all the way
    
    
    
   

he will give me grace and glory
he will give me grace and glory
he will give me grace and glory
and go with me with me all the way

children of the heavenly father
safely in his bosom gather
nestling bird nor star in heaven
such a refuge e’er was given
    
    
   
     
   

god his own doth tend and nourish
in his holy courts they flourish
from all evil things he spares them
in his mighty arms he bears them
   
  
  
    

neither life nor death shall ever
from the lord his children sever
unto them his grace he showeth
and their sorrows all he knoweth
     
   
    
   

praise the lord in joyful numbers
your protector never slumbers
at the will of your defender
ev’ry foeman must surrender
   
   
    
  


though he giveth or he taketh
god his children ne’er forsaketh
his the loving purpose solely
to preserve them pure and holy

lead kindly light amid th’ encircling
gloom lead thou me on
the night is dark and i am far from
home lead thou me on
  
     
  
     
 

keep thou my feet
i do not ask to see
the distant scene
one step enough for me
  
  
 
    

i was not ever thus nor prayed
that thou shouldst lead me on
i loved to choose and see my path
but now lead thou me on
      
 
      
 

i loved the garish day
and spite of fears
pride ruled my will
remember not past years
 
    
 
  

so long thy power hath blest me
sure it still will lead me on
o’er moor and fen o’er crag and torrent
till the night is gone
      
 
     
  


and with the morn
those angel-faces smile
which i have loved
long since and lost awhile
  
  
 
  


on the shore of jordan’s river
in expectation we all stand
there by faith we see the shimmer
of our new and promised land
   
   
   
   
   

let us live in expectation
of that moment when the lord
will receive us into his kingdom
as he promised in his word

   
   
    
   

like the sun in radiant glory
glows the new jerusalem
songs of praises tell the story
of that precious priceless gem
    
  
   
  

let us live in expectation
of that moment when the lord
will receive us into his kingdom
as he promised in his word

   
   
    
   

many saints their race have finished
crossed the jordan with a prayer
and we too shall cross that river
very soon we’ll all be there
   
   
   
    

let us live in expectation
of that moment when the lord
will receive us into his kingdom
as he promised in his word

   
   
    
   

shades of death engulf the river
but beyond its deathly throes
lies the kingdom of the blessed
and the end of all our woes
   
   
  
    


let us live in expectation
of that moment when the lord
will receive us into his kingdom
as he promised in his word

am i a soldier of the cross
a follower of the lamb
and shall i fear to own his cause
or blush to speak his name
     
     
   
     
   

must i be carried to the skies
on flowery beds of ease
while others fought to win the prize
and sailed through bloody seas
    
    
     
    

are there no foes for me to face
must i not stem the flood
is this vile world a friend to grace
to help me on to god
    
     
   
   


sure i must fight if i would reign
increase my courage lord
i’ll bear the toil endure the pain
supported by thy word
    
    
      
      


teach me lord how to pray in contrition
and your holy commands to fulfil
free my heart from its pride and ambition
may it always conform to your will
may it always conform to your will
   
   
   
   
    
    

may you reign in my heart without measure
and your spirit my spirit control
may in you i find all of my pleasure
and your name in my heart thus extol
and your name in my heart thus extol
     
     
    
    
    


cleansed within by the blood of my saviour
may my heart be kept free from all sin
may it find its delight and its favour
as it loves both my foes and my kin
as it loves both my foes and my kin
   
    
   
    
    


work for the night is coming
work through the morning hours
work while the dew is sparkling
work ’mid springing flowers

work in the glowing sun

something to keep in store
work for the night is coming
when man works no more
    
  
   
  

work for the night is coming
under the sunset skies
while their bright tints are glowing
work for daylight flies
  
   
   
 

work till the last beam fadeth
fadeth to shine no more
work while the night is darkening
when man’s work is o’er

when we all get to heaven
what a day of rejoicing that will be
when we all see jesus

while we walk the pilgrim pathway
clouds will overspread the sky
but when travelling days are over
not a shadow not a sigh

what a day of rejoicing that will be
when we all see jesus

am i a soldier of the cross
a follower of the lamb
and shall i fear to own his cause
or blush to speak his name
     



     
   
    
   

  
   
    
    
  
   
  

   
   
  
   
  

must i be carried to the skies
on flowery beds of ease
while others fought to win the prize
and sailed through bloody seas



    
   
    
   

  
   
    
    
  
   
  

   
   
  
   
  

are there no foes for me to face
must i not stem the flood
is this vile world a friend to grace
to help me on to god



     
    
    
  

  
   
    
    
  
   
  

   
   
  
   
  

sure i must fight if i would reign
increase my courage lord
i’ll bear the toil endure the pain
supported by thy word



     
    
   
    

  
   
    
    
  
   
  


   
   
  
   
  



through our god we shall do valiantly
it is he who will tread down our enemies
we’ll sing and shout his victory
christ is king christ is king christ is king

for god has won the victory
and set his people free
his word has slain the enemy
the earth shall stand and see that
repeat from start   
  through our god

rock of ages cleft for me
let me hide myself in thee
let the water and the blood
from thy wounded side which flowed
be of sin the double cure
save from wrath and make me pure
 
 
  
   
     
   
   
not the labour of my hands
can fulfil thy law’s demands
could my zeal no respite know
could my tears forever flow
all for sin could not atone
thou must save and thou alone
    
    
  
   
    
    
nothing in my hand i bring
simply to the cross i cling
naked come to thee for dress
helpless look to thee for grace
foul i to the fountain fly
wash me saviour or i die
     
     
     
    
    
    

while i draw this fleeting breath
when my eyes shall close in death
while i rise to worlds unknown
and behold thee on thy throne
rock of ages cleft for me
let me hide myself in thee

of the coming of the lord

in the evening dews and damps

by the dim and flaring lamps
his day is marching on

how canst thou lie asleep
when each moment so madly
is threatening
a grave in the angry deep

whether the wrath of the storm tossed sea
or demons or men or whatever it be

there is a green hill far away
outside a city wall
where the dear lord was crucified
who died to save us all
   
    
  
     
   

o dearly dearly has he loved
and we must love him too
and trust in his redeeming blood
and try his works to do

   
  
  
   

we may not know we cannot tell
what pains he had to bear
but we believe it was for us
he hung and suffered there
  
   
     
   

o dearly dearly has he loved
and we must love him too
and trust in his redeeming blood
and try his works to do

   
  
  
   

he died that we might be forgiv’n
he died to make us good
that we might go at last to heav’n
saved by his precious blood
   
   
    
   

o dearly dearly has he loved
and we must love him too
and trust in his redeeming blood
and try his works to do

   
  
  
   

there was no other good enough
to pay the price of sin
he only could unlock the gate
of heaven and let us in
   
  
   
  


o dearly dearly has he loved
and we must love him too
and trust in his redeeming blood
and try his works to do

and heart abandoned
in awe of the one who gave it all

calling “o sinner come home”

   
   
    
   


let us with rejoicing
congregate today
psalms to jesus voicing
give our joy full sway
-    
  
  
 
   

once in sin benighted
strangers you and i
through his blood united
we have been made nigh
  
  
  ’
  

sing his praises hallelujah
by his blood redeemed are we
in god’s book our names are written
written for eternity

  
    
   
  ’ 

not by sinai’s lightning
are we faced today
nor the thunder frightening
brings to us dismay
   ―
 
  
  

words of grace from calv’ry
come to you and me
by the blood of jesus
saved from wrath are we
   
 
„   
 ”

sing his praises hallelujah
by his blood redeemed are we
in god’s book our names are written
written for eternity

  
    
   
  ’ 

by his love directed
live we day by day
by the blood protected
on our heav’nly way
   
  
  
  

blessed truth ’tis written
in god’s word that we
through the blood of jesus
live eternally

sing his praises hallelujah
by his blood redeemed are we
in god’s book our names are written
written for eternity

amazing grace how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me
i once was lost but now am found
was blind but now i see
     
   
   
      
     

’twas grace that taught my heart to fear
and grace my fears relieved
how precious did that grace appear
the hour i first believed
   
   
     
   

thro’ many dangers toils and snares
i have already come
’tis grace that brought me safe thus far
and grace will lead me home
    
   
     
  

the earth shall soon dissolve like snow
the sun forbear to shine
but god who called me here below
shall be forever mine
   
    
       
   

yea when this flesh and heart shall fail
and mortal life shall cease
i shall possess within the veil
a life of joy and peace
    
  
    
   

when we’ve been there
ten thousand years
bright shining as the sun
we’ve no less days to sing god’s praise
than when we first begun
   
  
    
    

in tenderness he sought me
weary and sick with sin
and on his shoulders brought me
back to his fold again
while angels in his presence sang
until the courts of heaven rang
   
 
  
   
   
    
    

oh the love that sought me
oh the blood that bought me
oh the grace that brought me to the fold
wondrous grace that brought me to the fold

  
  
  
  
he washed the bleeding sin wounds
and poured in oil and wine
he whispered to assure me
“i’ve found thee thou art mine”
i never heard a sweeter voice
it made my aching heart rejoice
  
   
  
    
   
   

oh the love that sought me
oh the blood that bought me
oh the grace that brought me to the fold
wondrous grace that brought me to the fold

  
  
  
  
he pointed to the nail prints
for me his blood was shed
a mocking crown so thorny
was placed upon his head
i wondered what he saw in me
to suffer such deep agony
   
   
 
  
    
     

oh the love that sought me
oh the blood that bought me
oh the grace that brought me to the fold
wondrous grace that brought me to the fold

  
  
  
  
i’m sitting in his presence
the sunshine of his face
while with adoring wonder
his blessings i retrace
it seems as if eternal days
are far too short to sound his praise
  
     
  
    
   
     

oh the love that sought me
oh the blood that bought me
oh the grace that brought me to the fold
wondrous grace that brought me to the fold

  
  
  
  
so while the hours are passing
all now is perfect rest
i’m waiting for the morning
the brightest and the best
when he will call us to his side
to be with him his spotless bride
   
   
 
   
    
    


oh the love that sought me
oh the blood that bought me
oh the grace that brought me to the fold
wondrous grace that brought me to the fold

and vanish without trace

soon the final hour will near
and our saviour will appear

when final hour of life will come
and i must leave this earth
i’ll enter my eternal home
for which i’ve yearned since birth
    
  
    
   

hour by hour yes day by day
all our sorrows ebb away

and our saviour will appear

that at the final call
i will not fear nor be dismayed
for christ has made me whole
    
   
    
   

hour by hour yes day by day
all our sorrows ebb away
soon the final hour will near
and our saviour will appear

     
    
   
   

when that awaited moment comes
and i must leave this place
remember lord among your own
this servant saved by grace
   
   
    
 


hour by hour yes day by day
all our sorrows ebb away
soon the final hour will near
and our saviour will appear

     
    
   
   


precious moments we share
hearts rejoicing as we
congregate in the name of our lord
-   
 
  
   

jesus promised that he
present with us would be
let our hearts beat with his in accord
    
   
     

oh how pleasant it is
in his presence to meet
shutting out the world’s tumult and din
  
  
    

how rewarding it is
just to sit at his feet
and receive untold blessings from him
   
  
   

travel-weary we come
to this haven of rest
to relax where god’s waters still flow
 
   
    

then renewed and restored
by his spirit refreshed
on our way with rejoicing we’ll go
  
 
      

in a close-knit communion
with christ as our head
and endued with god’s power from high
  
 
    


on the pathway of life
we by him will be led
knowing god all our needs will supply
   
  
   


for all that you’ve done
i will thank you
for all that you’re going to do
for all that you’ve promised
and all that you are
is all that has carried me through

and i thank you thank you lord
